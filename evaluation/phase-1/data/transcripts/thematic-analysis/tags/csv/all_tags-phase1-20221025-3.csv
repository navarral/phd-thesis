1692,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:00:40.890 MODERATOR: If you can go one by one, and then do the tasks and i'm going to be timing these tasks."
1691,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:00:49.500 MODERATOR: Yes, please."
1933,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:01:28.590 P1: You don't have control anymore. 00:01:33.270 P1: it's very slow.
1969,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:04:31.110 P1: is quite a lag here I just know from your timing through the zoom.
1970,P1_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","00:04:40.470 you've got a nice little. 00:04:42.570 P1: pop up there doesn't disappear, though. 00:04:46.050 P1: Unless you click it again okay. 00:04:51.060 P1: Definitely. 00:04:52.650 P1: Possible there should be an all there, I think. 00:04:56.520 P1: that combines definitely high probability can possible."
1971,P1_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","00:05:47.910 P1: Okay, so this is just summarizing all the dates, where there has been flares. 00:05:54.420 P1: And our location of interests say Dublin. 00:05:58.020 P1: And you can select more than one."
1975,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:06:01.350 P1: Day range so it's not clear that this is a. 00:06:06.180 P1: date field, I just clicked on that I just found that there was one there and."
1976,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:06:14.160 P1: i'm just kind of struggling to get down there.
1690,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:06:17.550 MODERATOR: yeah I think it was a bit of luck.
1708,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:06:31.200 MODERATOR: You can you. 00:06:31.980 MODERATOR: can use does the scrolling work for you yeah well, you have to click here sorry."
1973,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:06:37.980 P1: yeah it's difficult because I. 00:06:45.360 P1: mean i'll try and pick something else. 00:06:49.680 P1: kind of write it in. 00:06:54.390 P1: And there's a lot there's a big lag actually so it's. 00:07:09.210 P1: very hard to reason it's very light Gray and.
1688,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:08:09.540 MODERATOR: for the experiment only data from 2020 is available. 00:08:14.460 MODERATOR: Okay, because I accounted for the like in this room and then my using my computer and everything."
1977,P1_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,00:09:03.750 P1: don't think you'd ever need directly or even a. 00:09:08.100 P1: spatial temporal aggregation made Min Max. 00:09:16.770 P1: And you can only select one of those okay. 00:09:21.570 P1: So I don't exactly scenario where you only need man for Max you would need main median or Min Max both together.
1687,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:10:08.400 MODERATOR: You want to read the next task.
2013,P1_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","Nice, there are two buttons that hope you interpret the data that you see."
2014,P1_Transcript.vtt,Unclear standardisation of the data,00:11:48.150 P1: It doesn't just say what if if the data is not normally distributed what happens like that would be useful to know.
2015,P1_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,00:12:43.290 P1: Excellent data sub tab.
1686,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:13:53.370 MODERATOR: No that's that's that's for me to control some stuff.
1685,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:14:05.040 MODERATOR: there's there's no more.
2016,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,00:14:24.990 P1: I guess it's not clarify that that score applies to just this data or the whole dataset.
2052,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:15:46.770 P1: Okay, so what's not clear to me, is exactly what we're looking at here. 00:15:52.050 P1: So this is only referring to. 00:15:55.980 P1: don't see how it relates to the patients."
2053,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:16:19.800 P1: I don't understand how this relates to patients I think what you're showing me here is. 00:16:26.340 P1: Basically, a summary for. 00:16:28.650 P1: For 2020."
2054,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:16:30.480 P1: But it doesn't have any relationship to the patient. 00:16:34.920 P1: Because, Sir, there are no patients with that, during that time period, so I think for running to the thing you might. 00:16:42.720 P1: expand your time period, so you definitely are events within that period."
1684,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:17:00.900 MODERATOR: task for.
2055,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:17:53.040 P1: there's a bit of a lag here
2056,P1_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:18:01.260 P1: And you can. 00:18:04.440 P1: click on this to zoom in and using the upper one that's what i'm seeing this is happening. 00:18:12.990 P1: Very cool. 00:18:21.360 P1: Thank you move your window back and forth. 00:18:27.090 P1: I can see here and they're kind of February first was a little bit outside their normal. 00:18:41.580 P1: Okay, so last time series very nice."
2057,P1_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:19:25.680 P1: Again, I think, for for ease you know these names of each along the X axis here. 00:19:33.570 P1: and 00:19:36.330 P1: The recipe, I mean I kind of know them, but it might be hard for a new person to understand what msl means, for example."
1683,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:21:25.110 MODERATOR: You can cancel those notes at my computer, please."
2058,P1_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,00:21:46.290 P1: i'm excited to see what progress.
1682,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:22:30.480 MODERATOR: Would you mind reading the text.
2059,P1_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:23:45.420 P1: I think that you know that this might be a bit too much for. 00:23:50.580 P1: me, certainly for this purpose bit too much to take in and for someone's brain."
2088,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,00:25:21.390 P1: So I mean one of the options here is no flare so i'm not quite sure what that means I guess it takes. 00:25:28.380 P1: All the encounters. 00:25:30.690 P1: Where flair is not mentioned.
2089,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:29:36.750 P1: Okay, so i'm assuming here that each line represents one encounter. 00:29:43.050 P1: Maybe it's still not clear to me about that, but."
1681,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:30:09.210 MODERATOR: You if you want to read it again mark.
2090,P1_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,00:32:09.930 P1: Combined to I guess one. 00:32:14.520 P1: Nice feature.
1680,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:33:20.220 MODERATOR: You can't see because this room over there screaming sorry like I can try to fix it give me a second yeah.
2091,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:33:33.510 P1: let's try again just comparing the ones. 00:33:58.680 P1: got this error message.
1709,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:34:00.660 MODERATOR: me and we take it up and. 00:34:06.930 MODERATOR: I cannot, I cannot control the mouse."
1678,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:35:08.700 MODERATOR: Go to click the red one, please."
1677,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:35:24.720 MODERATOR: They are actually the same quality, because you put it on the same let's let's move on as."
2092,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:37:36.870 P1: This kind of linkage to the flare event, I think, might be at the root of some of this these problems."
2093,P1_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:38:38.460 P1: So presuming each one of these what's on the X axis is. 00:38:44.820 P1: days are not sure.
1710,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:40:26.550 MODERATOR: Please continue, please. 00:40:29.910 MODERATOR: If you can please can't even save it to my computer, please."
1675,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:40:37.110 MODERATOR: What I bless it you can't you can go ahead, no."
1674,P1_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:41:02.400 MODERATOR: This one just to see what happens.
2146,P1_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,well it's really impressive means of. 00:41:43.050 P1: Exploring data.
2144,P1_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,00:41:49.260 P1: I think a little bit like last time. 00:41:52.410 P1: it's not clear what the objectives are here i'm not sure. 00:41:57.120 P1: You know the in terms of design of this for the users have been incorporated sufficient here in Austin and.
2145,P1_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:42:08.340 P1: We are. 00:42:10.050 P1: Providing a value in the data table and in the in the graphs. 00:42:17.850 P1: For each encounter. 00:42:24.690 P1: The best data from that encounter. 00:42:29.850 P1: I presume is the data from the county in which that encounter encounter occurred, rather than from the encounter itself. 00:42:41.520 P1: And it reflects the prevailing the prevailing. 00:42:48.690 P1: Whether or pollution values on that day. 00:42:53.340 P1: or in that month, so if you want to link this to kind of a by a biological our experimental research question. 00:43:02.700 P1: As we've discussed many times in the adverb project."
2147,P1_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:43:06.870 P1: The. 00:43:08.640 P1: If we're looking at flare events, we need to understand the prevailing pollution weather data in a period before the slayer. 00:43:18.270 P1: So there's a pro travel period, you know it really doesn't matter what the the weather's like of the day, or even so many of the month, because the month presumably will be the calendar month. 00:43:33.720 P1: And so the flare that may have happened, you know so sorry that happened at the end of the color calendar months, then."
2149,P1_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:43:40.920 P1: That might be helpful because it's the period, probably 123 or four weeks before the flare event. 00:43:49.080 P1: Or maybe even longer, because the patient doesn't always attend hospital immediately. 00:43:55.440 P1: that's The big challenge with all of this work is you know understanding that program will period. 00:44:00.570 P1: and 00:44:02.100 P1: So I think you probably need if you if you wanted, if this is going to be applied for this purpose and."
2150,P1_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,00:44:08.520 P1: They need something there that allows you to define a lag. 00:44:13.050 P1: You know the period where you can say well i'd like to see the data. 00:44:17.010 P1: You know one week two week three week or four weeks before the event or the encountering question.
2151,P1_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:44:33.390 P1: yeah, so I think that, I mean the explorations really nice"
2152,P1_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"yes, a few little bits where it's a bit tricky and there's a lag made it a bit more difficult as well"
2153,P1_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"know it's very nicely laid out and. 00:44:46.440 P1: Your time series is really nice like that and. 00:44:50.220 P1: But when we're exploring this from a research point of view, where. 00:44:54.330 P1: we're almost certainly never going to look at an individual patients, you know it's."
2154,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:44:59.700 P1: We need to have you know, large numbers of patients in each group. 00:45:05.220 P1: So I think reporting aggregate values is probably more important than exploring the individual patients but. 00:45:11.730 P1: But again, having access to the data table to show where the data is coming from, is also it's also useful and."
2155,P1_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"00:45:26.310 P1: yeah, so I think and it's it's quite intuitive in terms of running the test, I think I get people to read this the tasks before out so you got an idea took me a little while to. 00:45:38.160 P1: to work out what he wants me to do next. 00:45:43.080 P1: So, but yeah I mean it's a very famous very good to see us there and. 00:45:49.620 P1: see it in action, and I can certainly see this kind of approach."
2156,P1_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"00:45:54.930 P1: that's having a lot of applications beyond environment. 00:45:59.880 P1: The first one, I think, to think about is cider."
2157,P1_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"00:46:04.560 P1: You know the computerized infectious disease registry. 00:46:08.430 P1: That would be. 00:46:11.400 P1: Not too not too difficult, I mean basically it's the same thing in the sense that you have. 00:46:17.760 P1: For a given month, you have a number at a location and there might be a bit of good locations are not exactly matching your one so."
2158,P1_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"00:46:26.310 P1: and also the in terms of the environmental data. 00:46:30.060 P1: and 00:46:33.360 P1: You are deriving. 00:46:36.090 P1: From the actual weather stations, whereas I really think. 00:46:42.840 P1: You know I think you, you probably can't do that you know because. 00:46:49.290 P1: Inevitably we've had lots of meetings with chuck Gallagher about this is that, certainly with pollution. 00:46:54.450 P1: it's. 00:46:56.100 P1: There are so few pollution stations that you cannot tell what the patient's be as close to by looking at a station. 00:47:05.490 P1: that have hit the measurements from that station and. 00:47:09.300 P1: You need some kind of land use regression or something else that interprets the value for. 00:47:17.580 P1: A given pollutant. 00:47:20.310 P1: and 00:47:22.050 P1: This generally means what these interpolation things do they take a lot of different data sources, they take the local measurement, but they also use satellite data."
2160,P1_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:47:35.010 P1: You know, we have adopted this across of ours. 00:47:39.240 P1: Whereas you kind of seem to have gone a different way."
2161,P1_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:47:43.170 P1: And again, I think, early engagement with the wider team would it be important to identify that."
2159,P1_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"00:47:59.820 P1: yeah but I mean Actually, I mean the sources of data basically from Copernicus and. 00:48:08.850 P1: Global sources of data that's pretty easy to get access to that and use it as a data source, instead, perhaps you can think about man."
1695,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:00:32.370 MODERATOR: that's tasks to you should start in task, one which starts with."
1934,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,00:00:36.840 P2: Oh sorry i'm reading what i'm reading what's on your screen. 00:00:40.140 P2: But you want me to go back to my.
1696,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:00:41.970 MODERATOR: or sorry yes.
1693,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:02:46.050 MODERATOR: Controlling the screen.
1935,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"00:02:48.390 P2: I have. 00:02:50.280 P2: A I have a mouse moving around here on the screen, I thought it was working. 00:02:54.420 P2: It says i'm you are controlling go to the screen."
1702,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:02:57.690 MODERATOR: Okay, can you move it because I don't see it moving."
1703,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:03:01.860 MODERATOR: Do yes, yes perfect perfect sorry."
1936,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"00:03:35.160 P2: Okay, and that's not your fault, I understand that that's because of the lag."
1704,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:04:23.940 MODERATOR: know it just for you to understand where the data comes from that.
1937,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:04:45.030 P2: This would be easier if we were doing. 00:04:46.860 P2: In a place where you could set it up for me. 00:04:50.190 P2: With multiple screens
1705,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:05:22.830 MODERATOR: I don't want to interrupt you, but you mean the last part of the first task."
1938,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,00:05:26.760 Oh. 00:05:28.620 P2: You were. 00:05:30.510 P2: Okay
1939,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:06:41.340 P2: The data points density i'm not sure if I know what that means, but am 27 plus three is 30 that's what's going on there okay."
1940,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,"00:06:49.980 P2: And if I click back here yeah okay that makes sense sorry yep I did miss that task and Okay, so I need to go back one oh no it's it just opened them up OK, so now i'm going to go and do I think I had finished reading the query."
1978,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:07:39.510 P2: So, and now what I don't know from this is where the data includes high probability and above or just high probability only and which is something that might be worth being able to understand better and then I have."
1979,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"00:08:16.710 P2: have lots of Dublin ones okay fair enough and i'm going to select Dublin because there's loads of cases there might want to select multiple more than one not sure if that's possible, let me have a look sounds like Dublin anyway."
1980,P2_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","00:09:45.870 P2: spatial temporal aggregation I know what that means, but I guess, not everybody in the world would"
1981,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"I go to the mean the map domain, or should I go with the Max because that's kind of interesting. 00:09:58.500 P2: And i'll submission. 00:10:08.640 P2: hit submit I think yeah good."
2017,P2_Transcript.vtt,Confusing text descriptions,00:11:50.730 P2: I don't know why it has the word open in front of me that's not clear to me what that means
2018,P2_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries",but query input summary maybe makes more sense so that's me could think about.
2019,P2_Transcript.vtt,Confusing text descriptions,"00:12:31.380 P2: Again I don't grow the word open means there but that's Okay, and if there is no mystery 95% should be between."
2020,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"button allows you to select becomes interesting to export data Okay, so I could decide that i'm interested in and."
2021,P2_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries",00:14:39.030 P2: I want to keep someone's i've heard of before i've heard that one I know what seo is carbon monoxide very interesting and. 00:14:47.370 P2: I feel like okay so there's.
1711,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:16:09.840 MODERATOR: Account that's for. 00:16:10.890 P2: Monitoring our head. 00:16:12.390 MODERATOR: that's what it's for some admin stuff like.
2022,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:16:43.140 P2: Oh no I didn't want to that either now haha if I want to bring a call him back, how do I do that"
2023,P2_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"Oh, here we go good, so I want to come down to come back okay what I told him I do is to check because I seem to have I messed up the ordering."
2024,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,what i've learned here now is that the lowest no to in that six month period was on the seventh of know the fifth of July that's possibly conceivably useful sure Mrs water supply outside as well.
2025,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"00:18:11.820 P2: Quite reaches Okay, I think i've done a really good job of exploring the data task list okay and."
2026,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:18:42.570 P2: yeah when I go off to my to find the document when I come back it's not all.
2060,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"00:18:46.710 P2: immediately and controlling your screen but i'm getting there now Okay, so I saw this earlier it here time series so now, this is where you need to sign a statistician rather than a computer scientist like okay that looks like something I can understand."
2061,P2_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:21:28.710 P2: Okay, all right and range that I did that already okay cool so now i'm going to go to box plots."
1706,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:22:52.410 MODERATOR: there's a button, that is, which is the Cross next magnifying glass."
2062,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:24:03.660 P2: Some of these problems is the delay.
2094,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:25:10.380 P2: So i'm not sure if i'm going to order group is when we work with work away arrange a quiz into groups are you guys into groups and click on click to plot groups.
1712,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:27:53.970 MODERATOR: you combine these queries in the owner with. 00:27:56.070 MODERATOR: The previous to have the same task because you missed.
1697,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:28:00.000 MODERATOR: Can you should query two times so you have three queries to compare.
2095,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:28:29.100 P2: Okay, so i'm suddenly wondering it So these are. 00:28:32.160 P2: These. 00:28:34.620 P2: yeah i'm not i'm certainly wondering what relevance to uncover and all this has to that's right all i'm getting here is. 00:28:42.540 P2: weather and pollution days deep data for every day for six months in Dublin and it's got nothing to do and seems to me with whether somebody gosh. 00:28:51.180 P2: A vasculitis or not or had a high probability of flair or not i'm not sure i'm certainly not sure what that's all doing and in here and that's an issue because. 00:29:01.590 P2: I can compare whether pollution in other places I don't need to come here and you think, having listened to you for a long time in avert meetings that have some idea what that's doing but I. 00:29:12.630 P2: I don't because, as far as I can tell each record that i've been looking at is one day. 00:29:20.430 P2: And a day so i'm getting six months of of records, so I have no idea how that relates to a person with or without an ankle vasculitis okay anyway."
2096,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,00:30:02.700 P2: Not helps no at all and I can't see any reason to change any of this because I don't understand at all what this is doing.
2097,P2_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:30:09.930 P2: What I do these things are doing for me on I don't serve so from my perspective, all that stuff above there is not relevant because i'm basically getting. 00:30:18.480 P2: Whether inclusion data for Dublin for this for this for this range of dates Okay, and this time I got to go with whether again, but I got to get the Max whether I go into submission."
2100,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"00:31:02.190 P2: Okay, too much of a lag"
2098,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:32:02.880 P2: OK so i'm out of my depth here right i'm really don't understand why we want to do anything in groups because i'm not a i'm not a researcher and but I go to groups so that I have some chance to maybe keep tabs of what's going on.
2099,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"Okay, so I don't have those variables in my two things might be more sensible to do. 00:33:31.620 P2: To group, but there are both the same my data story matters and MINS okay so Max is no means an axis, so I won't have any variable costs to accept days and I don't know if you've got days in your last operating on the boys."
2101,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:34:12.690 P2: So, as I said, i'm a bit lost so i'm going to try and i'm going to try and change this so that so that I can compare."
2102,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:34:56.730 P2: So i'm going to do group ones q3 so I don't I still, as I say, don't tell the group is and."
2103,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:35:43.650 P2: On all my months from my months so that makes some sense, and so I suppose I don't really and I don't know what the Group word means and all of this, but."
2104,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:36:28.230 P2: I would have thought it might be an interesting to over that time period to plot say whether the temperature and PM 25 or. 00:36:36.330 P2: Something and something, but I don't know how I could have done that, given the way the groups were offered to me here."
1694,P2_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:40:46.020 MODERATOR: Because you were the loading into my computer I just press cancel. 00:40:49.410 MODERATOR: Okay.
2143,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,00:40:50.940 P2: OK so that's how I would export that data that makes sense and then this one exported all the data does okay so seven says my overall impressions and.
2162,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"00:41:03.630 P2: Okay, and so my overall impressions is it's useful in terms of ways, looking at environmental variables"
2163,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"and a possibly I misunderstood something about the grouping, so I wasn't able to do."
2164,P2_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:41:19.350 P2: What would seem to me to be useful to compare one variable against another one across a time series, or maybe multiple variables across a time series."
2165,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:41:27.840 P2: And, and that may be misunderstanding your mind and and I also as i've explained don't understand the how what relationship, there is between the. 00:41:41.940 P2: vasculitis high probability of flare and the days that i'm looking at I basically as far as I can make out with looking at data."
2166,P2_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,00:42:06.060 P2: For all the days in that time period which is seems to be completely independent of whether somebody had a flare or not so that's I think I explained those to come come and complications.
2167,P2_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"00:42:18.330 P2: Throughout the interview so and he it was it was I was a what was able to do everything I was supposed to do, I can't help, I was able to do everything was supposed to do."
2168,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:42:31.080 P2: And, but the things that I was able to do were reasonably easy to do some of the buttons took a little while to find that, because some are very small, given the way in which we were carrying out this. 00:42:41.490 P2: exercise which wasn't ideal on my laptop screen and and, and so my yeah so my overall experience was a little bit frustrating, I suppose, because of the, as I say, the setup and the delays."
2168,P2_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"00:42:31.080 P2: And, but the things that I was able to do were reasonably easy to do some of the buttons took a little while to find that, because some are very small, given the way in which we were carrying out this. 00:42:41.490 P2: exercise which wasn't ideal on my laptop screen and and, and so my yeah so my overall experience was a little bit frustrating, I suppose, because of the, as I say, the setup and the delays."
2169,P2_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:42:55.890 P2: A and a little bit confusing because of the two things i'm confused, but I don't understand groups very well"
2170,P2_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"I don't understand the relationship between the disease and the flares and whatever, so I think i've done as much as I can do by summarizing probably my experience."
2170,P2_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"I don't understand the relationship between the disease and the flares and whatever, so I think i've done as much as I can do by summarizing probably my experience."
1707,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:01:59.820 MODERATOR: So Would you mind for us finishing task one.
1941,P3_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,"00:02:04.470 P3: task one oh right sorry. 00:02:12.330 P3: Oh right, yes, sir."
1713,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:03:29.220 MODERATOR: I think that's because of the live chat. 00:03:32.460 MODERATOR: Let me, let me fix it. 00:03:40.200 MODERATOR: Now you can you can go again."
1942,P3_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:03:54.150 P3: Changing I don't see my mouse doesn't seem to be interacting with it.
1714,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:03:59.880 MODERATOR: Okay, maybe you need to click again some window."
1943,P3_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:04:14.550 P3: Whether to data density points three So what does that mean. 00:04:22.170 P3: The populations here whether their.
1715,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:04:36.840 MODERATOR: Make sure you read the names correctly Jim.
1716,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:05:37.860 MODERATOR: It will be the second.
1944,P3_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:05:40.140 P3: Okay well that's not very clear, so I would just make up."
1717,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:06:05.040 MODERATOR: Exactly.
1982,P3_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"okay so i'm interested in i'm Kurt yes event of interest let's go with definite location. 00:07:11.010 P3: He. 00:07:12.600 P3: invented interest dates. 00:07:16.140 P3: Okay, so these are all the date. 00:07:19.530 P3: In various counties, that would be will be have a document flair."
1718,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:07:41.520 MODERATOR: is for the whole for the whole country, so all right."
1983,P3_Transcript.vtt,Confusing text descriptions,"00:07:44.760 P3: All right, Okay, well, I would maybe have brackets click here, if you want the whole country. 00:07:52.590 P3: But, in general, what kind of probably want the whole country you know, because you own the dope lemon court cup like high density of cases."
1719,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:08:27.390 MODERATOR: it's a stations.
1984,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:09:40.650 P3: For that month or the third presumably the date refers to the date that they had a definite flare, so I would want like a month. 00:09:52.500 P3: or two months or three months or four months or five months or six months. 00:09:57.090 P3: of data of each variable prior to that flatter."
1985,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:10:02.640 P3: And I want to be able to aggregate there by daily average monthly up probably monthly average. 00:10:13.170 P3: and 00:10:15.570 P3: be able to compare the monthly average let's say in the month leading up to that date, compared to the three months prior to that date So what is this telling me."
1720,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:10:32.760 MODERATOR: Just straight to move forward.
1986,P3_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"8.400 P3: So let's go with monthly, although I don't know what month are you giving me I want the mean usually"
1987,P3_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"but I, like the fact that there's a Min and Max."
1988,P3_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,00:10:56.130 P3: I still don't really know what it's given me but anyway we'll see what comes up with.
1989,P3_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,00:11:01.080 P3: I like where you're going with it there.
1990,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:11:04.560 P3: This is what I would plan to do in fact I was thinking of how to aggregate this data from the raw data dump that out, someone give me. 00:11:16.620 P3: But also, what I want is. 00:11:21.930 P3: So I want to look at let's say the monthly averages prior to be the basket like flares"
1991,P3_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,well i'd also want to be able to pull a different date that they were in remission.
1721,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:11:41.940 MODERATOR: No that's perfect like the more the better for me to just do.
1992,P3_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,00:12:03.960 P3: yeah and i'd want to be able to let say uplift a csv file to say for these ideas and these dates get me the data prior to that.
1722,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:12:45.930 MODERATOR: Do you want, do you want to go pocket fitting the task."
2027,P3_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"Oh, we have suffered outside that's exciting,"
2028,P3_Transcript.vtt,Unclear standardisation of the data,"What about if they're not normally distributed which i'm sure, a lot of the data. 00:16:20.520 P3: Especially if you're looking at clinical data, a lot of it will be not normally distributed."
1723,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:17:05.970 MODERATOR: that's that's for me.
1724,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:17:15.360 MODERATOR: it's fine.
2029,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:18:23.100 P3: That doesn't make sense, then, because. 00:18:26.190 P3: It doesn't match up with the dates of the. 00:18:30.330 P3: Air like what I want is for each ID. 00:18:34.920 P3: player date I want aggregated data for every month prior to that flare for like six or 12 months. 00:18:43.200 P3: Whereas this i'm getting. 00:18:46.080 P3: A random date range that I put in there that doesn't actually equate to the flare dates at all is that right."
1725,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:18:54.150 MODERATOR: yeah I need to prove it in the next one.
2063,P3_Transcript.vtt,Unclear standardisation of the data,"00:20:15.300 P3: What kind of foundation standardization, is it doing."
2064,P3_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:21:22.230 P3: A time and relax versus the time and not relapse and while here, you might be able to look at all the patients together and see like his brain full way down here for all the patients. 00:21:36.390 P3: But if we're looking to compare a patient to themselves, you don't want a plot of their relapse versus a plot of their permission, you know just by by side, but also, you need to standardize."
2065,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:21:52.740 P3: The. 00:21:53.910 Plus. 00:21:56.250 P3: like this. 00:21:58.200 P3: confused that we're looking at this doesn't relate to any patient this stuff related to a period of time, so like where is the flare on this plot, you know it should really be. 00:22:11.220 P3: flare is here."
2066,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:22:43.530 P3: So, in order to see a consistent POPs in and multiple people over time. 00:22:49.710 P3: You almost need to parallel plot all the people who are having a flare and have flare at time zero, and then the average of."
1726,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:23:00.870 MODERATOR: All the variables yep yep.
2067,P3_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:24:26.850 P3: i'm not sure if that useful to have that standardized because. 00:24:33.900 P3: Like would you not really want to see what the actual absolute values are.
1727,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:24:39.900 MODERATOR: You seeing the following tasks.
2068,P3_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:24:49.440 P3: Like I don't know what the entire quarter ranges for each variable so the absolute Barry ation might be quite small or it might be quite big so i'm not really sure what the benefit of his club is.
1728,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:25:29.490 MODERATOR: will come this comes in later.
2069,P3_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,but what does this relate to when does this. 00:26:50.970 P3: relate to who does it relate to. 00:26:54.390 P3: And what relevance is the rain. 00:27:01.320 P3: Again i'm not sure how this person on devices.
1729,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:27:11.100 MODERATOR: For you.
1730,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:28:35.520 MODERATOR: Island selected again.
1731,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:33:01.140 MODERATOR: That that's let's. 00:33:06.810 MODERATOR: keep going.
2105,P3_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:34:27.000 P3: So what would be more useful is if this variable higher or lower in different disease activity states. 00:34:40.380 P3: Actually, that will be very useful okay. 00:34:44.910 P3: Because in essence that's what we're trying to see. 00:34:49.830 P3: cuz because it's not we don't have enough people in each county to compare let's face the onset of anchor in Galway vs core because that heavily dependent on."
2106,P3_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"00:35:02.490 P3: The fact that we're all based in Dublin so more people get diagnosed up here and where this kind of thing will be useful, is an equinox kind of thing where you're comparing on code yes versus a control. 00:35:17.760 P3: Whereas we have to compare between the individual because we have only anka compared to nothing, so we have to compare relapse and remission."
2108,P3_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:35:47.820 P3: Some labels on this graph will be. 00:35:58.920 P3: different from what. 00:36:06.750 P3: So with these coordinates. 00:36:10.440 P3: No. 00:36:12.810 P3: absolutely no idea what this ground.
2107,P3_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,00:36:17.970 P3: And the time series. 00:36:22.530 P3: is still seem to want to work for me doesn't.
1732,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:36:25.470 MODERATOR: Think it's it broke.
1733,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:36:31.440 MODERATOR: Yes, please."
1734,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:37:10.110 MODERATOR: Let me close it otherwise you don't have to worry to my computer okay.
1735,P3_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:38:05.130 MODERATOR: It now it's in mind.
2171,P3_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,"well, I thought the tasks are very easy to understand."
2172,P3_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,00:38:24.060 P3: The dashboard is relatively easy to go than the things that I mentioned already um.
2173,P3_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:38:30.600 P3: Well, as I said, the outcome is where I would adjust."
2174,P3_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:38:41.640 P3: You want to be able to compare. 00:38:46.470 P3: Like, for example, we don't know, is it. 00:38:50.190 P3: sulfur dioxide. 00:38:52.920 P3: In the. 00:38:54.870 P3: Sixth, month prior to the flare or is it the sulfur dioxide average over the last 654 months prior to flare so it will be helpful to have like loads of different options to compare. 00:39:19.020 P3: And ultimately yeah compare like point zero is the date."
2175,P3_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,00:39:25.980 P3: relapse or remission and what does the standardized variable look like prior to that dates.
2176,P3_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"00:39:35.490 P3: Because we're not called with my uvb analysis we imagine that the uvb was going to be much higher in remission been a relapse So if I was looking at that visually. 00:39:48.870 P3: I might have it relapse graph down here. 00:39:53.250 P3: On a readmission appear, or it could be on the same graph in different colors and you know you could be here for one stage of setup here for the other, but you know it has to be centered at zero for the event."
1736,P5_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:02:29.250 MODERATOR: yeah it's fine.
1737,P5_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:03:11.160 MODERATOR: Remember what the task is asking just to acknowledge what data come from just. 00:03:19.020 MODERATOR: You have to go too deep into this.
1945,P5_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,00:03:21.480 P5: Oh sorry I. 00:03:25.560 P5: Once you feel you understand where the data comes from.
1946,P5_Transcript.vtt,Technical session issues,"00:04:08.700 P5: it's not a problem with the APP it's just i'm working on one screen, just so you know that, for your analysis okay i'm."
1947,P5_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:04:58.800 P5: The otherwise stuff data points available. 00:05:01.710 P5: yeah so I mean each county I guess they're kind of divided up into counties. 00:05:06.720 P5: each other number of data points available okay um, so I think that's the first test on so okay yep okay cool um."
1993,P5_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"00:06:09.990 P5: Events of interest flare there's a little. 00:06:13.080 P5: tool tip I guess. 00:06:16.050 P5: Oh, oh OK that explains the type of the ad yeah."
1994,P5_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"Oh, we can we can select more than one oh, I see okay okay okay yeah."
1995,P5_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","So these are all the options available and Darren has way more than the orders. 00:07:17.550 P5: you're doing this just telling me that there's these are where the flares are. 00:07:22.080 P5: Okay, this is where I select location of interest yeah so let's say let's just click Claire we don't. 00:07:30.180 P5: think that was here."
1996,P5_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:07:36.330 P5: Okay, and I can select more than one yeah okay there's a tick box here saying ireland's. 00:07:43.320 P5: i'm not sure what that means, unless the some of these locations of interest or outside of Ireland. 00:07:51.570 P5: yeah I don't know i'm gonna stick it anyway, why not."
1927,P5_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:08:00.120 MODERATOR: So just make sure you understand why you click Ireland. 00:08:04.980 P5: I don't know. 00:08:06.090 MODERATOR: Okay okay.
1740,P5_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:08:12.240 MODERATOR: Just clicked it then no problem, and then we can discuss it later."
1997,P5_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"00:09:01.290 P5: And then the aggregation method use Okay, this is pretty handy So what do I want the mean of the monthly weather and pollution or where are the men are the Max of the monthly what our pollution."
1741,P5_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:09:47.550 MODERATOR: yep.
2030,P5_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","00:11:12.210 P5: Okay, so it's just this just repeats okay why what my query was."
2031,P5_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,I think the destinations are fine. 00:13:03.600 P5: And yeah. 00:13:06.900 P5: then read the data read read the text and the data soap tab and talk through the interpretations variable cell background colors okay
2032,P5_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,00:13:42.750 P5: Okay yeah that's that's that seems handy i'm.
1742,P5_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:13:59.820 MODERATOR: For me, is for me to monitor. 00:14:01.470 P5: Oh sorry. 00:14:05.370 MODERATOR: You want to take it."

2077,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:35:44.700 P7: But yeah you can so you can see when speed when direction point. 00:35:49.200 P7: or curious, can you can you download this specific raw information as a or you can just download this PNG file or jpg or PNG is just not the data with it. 00:36:04.560 P7: would be a nice bonus I guess."
2078,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:36:08.460 P7: And the colors it I i'm not sure if the colors help or not. 00:36:17.550 P7: Coming coops and the zoom zoom.
2079,P7_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,00:36:57.030 P7: Good visualization but not sure what i'm going to use it for in my spirit in my area
2118,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:40:19.470 P7: And alone, but you can combine these queries into groups to potentially increase the signal to noise ratio signal to noise ratio is in language i'm already familiar with, I guess, but it would be a term that I would appreciate a. 00:40:36.810 P7: definition for. 00:40:39.090 P7: And can appreciate, though the noise side of things, but maybe not the signal."
1794,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:41:32.100 MODERATOR: Okay, make sure you understand what our group is."
1795,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:42:18.930 MODERATOR: To combine combined between groups know between queries. 00:42:24.900 MODERATOR: I need to make it clear.
1796,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:43:14.640 MODERATOR: concatenate.
1797,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:43:21.420 MODERATOR: touch after so you have everything.

1799,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:44:17.610 MODERATOR: Go ahead.
2119,P7_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:46:42.480 P7: What does that mean, though, in terms of triggers So if you could separate like counties that had no triggers on ones that did have triggers."
2120,P7_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"This is great point and to its most well okay there's there's there's very significant values here now, this."
1800,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:47:37.800 MODERATOR: loud.
2121,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:47:40.530 P7: For me, for me, it's like it is preventing the the box plots from being extended to the magnitude that they're at is there a way to switch them off."
1801,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:47:53.160 MODERATOR: My. 00:47:53.460 MODERATOR: You might go well.
2122,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:47:55.530 P7: Okay i'll be interested to be able to turn it off, so the scale, so I could actually look at PM and great that I can hover over it and see all the different key values related to that the box plot there."
2123,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,00:49:22.680 P7: So to your visualizations yeah usually the usefulness of the distribution of not seeing it.
1802,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:50:19.590 MODERATOR: And what happens with export.
2198,P7_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,00:51:03.660 P7: yeah generally okay probably a rush to little bit times was my own fault for not reading the instructions and few instructions just need clarity.
2199,P7_Transcript.vtt,Unclear standardisation of the data,00:51:21.240 P7: yeah i'm not quite sure about all of the plots like the district normal distribution plot and it's fine you.
2200,P7_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,00:51:29.790 P7: Probably great that there is so many variables wondering if the columns versus table.
2201,P7_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"00:51:39.450 P7: Traditional to have all of these horizontally, but when there's so many, I wonder, because it's a data to your really. 00:51:48.180 P7: yeah trying to debate, why do I need to see all this."
2202,P7_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:51:53.430 P7: F, really, the main objective is to download these one so it's good that you can plot, and so on."
2202,P7_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"00:51:53.430 P7: F, really, the main objective is to download these one so it's good that you can plot, and so on."
2204,P7_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,00:52:11.730 P7: One thing i'm kind of thinking about is this advent of interest. 00:52:17.850 P7: And the link because currently have been just looking at environmental and climate data without really appreciating this aspect.
1803,P7_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:52:29.070 MODERATOR: Within us towards.
2203,P7_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"00:52:31.200 P7: So that's the bit that, and you know these dates I looked at them, but. 00:52:37.770 P7: The joining the dots is not. 00:52:39.270 P7: Currently there for me so that's a really um."
1957,P8_Transcript.vtt,Complex task instructions,00:02:47.070 P8: Okay let's try this. 00:02:51.510 P8: Okay vasculitis island.
1806,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:02:55.200 MODERATOR: No, do you mind reading the task again."
1807,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:03:29.910 MODERATOR: Okay.
1808,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:04:20.670 MODERATOR: Remember, which stop you reading."
1958,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:05:29.190 P8: Okay that's really nice, you can see the pollution measurement what would, I think some pollution measurement with a number."
1809,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:07:24.210 MODERATOR: something about bite is a Python package.
1959,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:08:00.270 P8: Okay, so for navigating the map. 00:08:03.570 P8: box select. 00:08:05.670 P8: Okay, so you can. 00:08:08.400 P8: select all this is really cool."
1810,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:09:36.570 MODERATOR: So, can you tell me what the data comes from."
1960,P8_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,00:09:58.230 P8: assumed this corresponds this aggregated data by region.
1850,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:10:27.480 MODERATOR: But you you haven't gotten anything, yet this is the home view."
1811,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:10:33.480 MODERATOR: And I wanted to ask you, so in task one bears and once you feel you understand where the data comes from so what's the data source of weather pollution and iris on data."
1812,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:11:07.020 MODERATOR: Tell me, what are these data control. 00:11:09.900 P8: So the weather data seems to come from the Irish which your logical. 00:11:14.610 MODERATOR: That that's."

2006,P8_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,00:14:37.320 P8: To do personal aspirations okay that's really nice. 00:14:42.420 P8: So a flare can be divided into three category definite option high probability and possible.
2007,P8_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"00:16:45.930 P8: Okay, so it seems like you get more more events. 00:16:54.690 P8: So it seems to combine the events for definite high probability. 00:17:05.220 P8: As more. 00:17:07.440 P8: event date seems to be appearing from the raw data."
1815,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:17:56.400 MODERATOR: Be understand why you click diagram.
2008,P8_Transcript.vtt,Complex data linking process,"00:18:01.980 P8: I assume, if you have multiple countries let's say you had the United Kingdom, you could flick maybe whales. 00:18:15.930 P8: But that's that's the assumption that i'm making."
1816,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,"00:18:20.130 MODERATOR: Okay, if it's not clear it's completely fine it's easy to do and do it just for you to understand afterwards."
2009,P8_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,00:19:50.490 P8: So i'm interested in let's say daily. 00:19:56.490 P8: let's see if it gives me an option to choose monthly so you can only choose one option at a time okay so that's good.
1817,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:20:03.030 MODERATOR: So from. 00:20:03.870 MODERATOR: From data sources can choose one option or multiple options.
2010,P8_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"00:20:59.010 P8: yeah I was still be nice to have maybe if you can have all these three, but you can always query them separately, but yet keep in mind nicely efficient to maybe have all three."
1818,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:22:07.440 MODERATOR: You want to read them of the task to.
1819,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:22:51.360 MODERATOR: You would start reading task created one.
1820,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,00:24:08.820 MODERATOR: Doing I think up boys really fast. 00:24:13.950 MODERATOR: But go ahead.
2039,P8_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","00:25:40.650 P8: The second part, which is OK period time be aggregation so provides a nice summary of what she requested."
2040,P8_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","00:26:45.240 P8: So that was the first task that makes sense of the. 00:26:49.830 P8: two options that makes explanation. 00:26:53.670 P8: yeah seems to be good kinda just shows you what you requested, and there are no confusion, sometimes you maybe click things to fascinate don't cannot actually explains what were the different options."
2041,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:29:47.400 P8: And then comes back, we have selected okay that's very cool."
2042,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"00:30:13.320 P8: Okay that's really cool. 00:30:19.200 P8: So you've got the numbers which the columns which white slightly light Gray okay so just a normal table. 00:30:31.590 P8: And then within each each column. 00:30:37.650 P8: Okay, you can order them. 00:30:40.770 P8: You can order them by higher low. 00:30:44.490 P8: And then it changes the table accordingly. 00:30:49.320 P8: Okay, so it makes sense to just order them a year and then a month."

2206,P8_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","01:03:15.990 P8: yeah So the first impression when you get in is that you have like you know, a website with a few simple instructions and not too much information. 01:03:27.480 P8: Because some website just I just saw it just overwhelm you with information so it's like what it does, how to use the dashboard and then this way the data source comes coming from."
2207,P8_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,"01:03:41.400 P8: And then, it gives you, you can look at things from the map. 01:03:48.450 P8: The map at first. 01:03:52.530 P8: You think see it's color coded. 01:03:58.320 P8: Based on a scale. 01:04:03.300 P8: From more from cold to warm and then you. 01:04:08.130 P8: You i'm just going to zoom in sorry if i'm taking long i'm just. 01:04:13.350 P8: Trying to play replay the things in my head. 01:04:16.290 Just thinking. 01:04:19.620 P8: So the color coding of the map. 01:04:24.120 P8: You think it's corresponds to the map itself. 01:04:28.230 P8: But I think it refers to the zit school for the values that you have in there. 01:04:37.830 P8: So that was the one thing that was a bit. 01:04:43.830 P8: Confusing at first, because you. 01:04:46.320 P8: You you look at the color coding of the map for each county and then you. 01:04:52.710 P8: The data point density Okay, so I guess, I should just read this property. 01:04:58.290 P8: regions so you're trying to make sense of the of the data point density, whether they're referring to them to the map itself the different countries and then you when you click on each country it's Nice that you can see a value. 01:05:13.350 P8: But you the values you like Oh, does it mean. 01:05:17.280 Okay."
2208,P8_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"01:05:19.620 P8: But until you start playing around which is, which is the whole point is that jonah query the data, so you get this the query part is really nice"

2131,P8_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"01:05:50.310 P8: us assume that each event date probably first to each person or something in an event, you don't show that Professor each person will just you know one person with multiple events or something."
2129,P8_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"01:06:06.240 P8: But at the end of the day, you looking at aggregated data so maybe you're not interested individual data so that that should be fun."
2210,P8_Transcript.vtt,Environmental data prior to flare events,"01:06:15.600 P8: But then you think so, you want to maybe isolate from looking at all the data to maybe looking at you know specific locations. 01:06:25.980 P8: From this just brief summary you're not sure whether."
2211,P8_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries","01:06:32.310 P8: And then the date range is nice, you can select what you want."
2130,P8_Transcript.vtt,Visualization of plots complex,01:06:38.160 P8: Maybe it could be nice to have like a little information.
2212,P8_Transcript.vtt,"Helpful text, tooltips and summaries",01:06:45.270 P8: You know what data is available.
1845,P8_Transcript.vtt,Moderator assist,01:06:49.650 MODERATOR: Okay.

2219,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,01:10:17.100 P8: You have an idea. 01:10:19.650 P8: What the data looks like. 01:10:25.590 P8: yeah i'm sure if I had gone to daily daily data aggregate data that that even get more information. 01:10:35.700 P8: Which is quite Nice.
2220,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"01:10:38.190 P8: And then, so that was that was nice part. 01:10:45.540 P8: So all the plots really like."
2221,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"01:10:49.380 P8: What most people in the field, I used to is maybe having the role, having separate. 01:10:58.230 P8: Having separate variables, so what I was thinking, I was going to see was. 01:11:05.910 P8: Basically, this as a box plot. 01:11:10.680 P8: And just show you. 01:11:15.780 P8: So the values themselves Okay, this is still the Z score, which shows you kind of the Z score should follow the trend of the actual road data right. 01:11:27.420 P8: Okay."
2222,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"01:11:28.920 P8: So either way it's just as a way to normalize the data, so you can compare them on the same plot okay. 01:11:36.720 P8: yeah I mean I mean it's fine I mean, because at the end of the day, you just want to get an idea of the pattern, and she access to data."
2223,P8_Transcript.vtt,Additional features,"01:11:52.650 P8: If i'm thinking about people in the medical field. 01:11:57.810 P8: Sometimes they love, they would love. 01:12:01.680 P8: Individual plots for each pollutant but that will just create too much additional work you. 01:12:10.290 P8: Okay, so you could have like let's say."
2224,P8_Transcript.vtt,Good data exploration features,"01:12:30.780 P8: But at the end of the day, this whole thing is to help people you've integrated the data in the back end and you want to access the raw data and then visually look at it, so I think for me like this is this is perfectly fine the plots really."
2225,P8_Transcript.vtt,Useful data linkage and export features,"01:12:54.420 P8: And also like that you can make multiple requests, instead of you have the option to download them individually, but then you have an option to download them as a zip file, which is really. 01:13:07.830 P8: Much more efficient way of. 01:13:10.680 P8: of getting this data."
2226,P8_Transcript.vtt,Useful and easy to use approach,01:13:14.370 P8: So yeah. 01:13:16.170 P8: So the I like the simplicity
