157
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:55.890
P9: background colors okay talk to have the data table the columns that you want to display Okay, not a vertical.

158
00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.770
P9: Let me see.

159
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:32.190
P9: For example, here in rain corner, there is one red.

160
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.920
P9: One red.

161
00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.680
P9: Value background and which is the maximum number.

162
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.830
P9: Of this column.

163
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.010
P9: And for me is.

164
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:56.340
P9: Also it chooses 10,034 I can say that it is also the maximum number.

165
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.420
P9: Here the guru partners, which should be should indicated.

166
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.660
P9: The lower the minimum number of each column.

167
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.800
P9: I think so, yes, I think it is.

168

MODERATOR: know you go on the top.

172
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.270

173
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.740
P9: If the data if data is normally distributed.

174
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.170
P9: 95% should be between my minus two.

175
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.420
P9: plus two.

176
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:04.080
P9: Values greater than two are high, and they are read by values.

177
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.990
P9: Less than minus two are low and below so here.

178
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.650
P9: 5.6 is not this down to minus two but it isn't it is blue.

179
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:26.970
P9: and

180

P9: I should do.

194
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.560
P9: is to check for the time series.

195
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.590
P9: Right.

196
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.860

221
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.250
P9: This is.

222
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:25.980

P9: OK, this visualization time series.

225
00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:41.730
P9: visual history long time this specializations interactive for the law.

226
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.260
P9: We can some on top or other.

227
00:24:48.870 --> 00:25:00.900
P9: Can download as PNG even we can save the plot for legend at the ride the collective valuable and select.

228
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:09.510
P9: or Double Click to say, for example, if I selected rain, it gives me the box.

P9: Then I click man's.

236
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.850
P9: He says click the barrier to select and Double Click to select only.

237
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.760

P9: Okay, Nice.

242
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.270
P9: And then poor range is slide there.

243
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.270
P9: This ranges like Kelly can direct the selectivity.

244
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.220
P9: lot.

245
00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.540

P9: 20.

249
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.170
P9: minutes go to either.

250
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.320
P9: This.

251
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.910
P9: This is the.

252
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:55.830
P9: temperature.

253
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:06.090
P9: Okay, and all of them are in the same corner.

254
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.190
P9: Then.

255
00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.740
P9: We can also save the clock in solar cloud.

256
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:31.110
P9: Is the radius length indicates the wind dissipate and the degrees of the wind direction this visual is interactive or so.

257
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.180
P9: Okay, but if you do not have or not we should choose.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.030
P9: me to.

259
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.170
P9: This is for wine dependence.

260
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.990
P9: Complex variable wine dependencies, for example.

261
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.300
P9: temperature.

262
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:00.900
P9: Okay.

263
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.450

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.270
P9: For each point man I gotta.

267
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.650
P9: Let me, let me when I got there and.

268
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:33.660
P9: When I saw on the update for each point, it gives me the information, for example, temperature.

269
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:41.220
P9: wt is Peter videotape Dr, although I don't know what are these.

270
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:46.260
P9: Information, but it is very informative yes.

273
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.000
MODERATOR: Yes or no, you can move to task.

274
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.940
P9: task five but is that, in short.

275
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:11.580
MODERATOR: And not task five and the next tasks so tasks number fights in a PDF document.

276
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.840
P9: notorious query to end quality.

277
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.430
Okay.

278
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:35.040
P9: Okay, I should create two other queries and submit them that's it.

279
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.630
MODERATOR: And then i'm going to give you control or you can even go.

280
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:12.840
P9: Stop this query this is query one tab I don't want it anymore, but I keep it open, but if I check on parity no icon to.

281
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.950
P9: create a new query.

282
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:29.820
P9: It means that you should choose and co vasculitis here land here I choose for.

283
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.020
P9: North.

284
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.840
P9: And again from the same block for.

285
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:58.980
P9: long for the data range that, for example, again, the same day, which is in.

286
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.490
P9: In February.

287
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.030
P9: T.

288
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.370
P9: Data source.

289
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.640
P9: Now, generating computer.

290
00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:02.340
P9: Yes, it's done and, at the same time I.

291
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.710
P9: choose another.

292
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:06.870
P9: query.

293
00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.820
P9: Please, the event of interest should be.

294
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.040
P9: should be.

295
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.430
P9: This time I.

296
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:19.740
P9: choose the.

297
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:22.800
P9: policy.

298
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.720
P9: And they came the same information, but here like for.

299
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.890
P9: There is not the same.

300
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.330
P9: And then here at.

301
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.290
P9: This is for.

302
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.590
P9: test, so I choose.

303
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.060
P9: Okay, now I can compare.

304
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.190
P9: The quick.

305
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.380
P9: In comparative.

306
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:13.230
P9: query data previously submitted in this lesson can be conquered by specific by you can combine these queries into groups with the multiple selection inputs.

307
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:31.500
P9: Because, all of them are langford I love to group all three together into a potential increase the signal to noise ratio decide the number of course that you wish to compare selected which careers, you want to.

308
00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:36.660
P9: explore issues environmental the different class.

309
00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:44.820
P9: to generate coral reefs number of columns here I should choose, for example.

310
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:49.140
P9: So groups know.

311
00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:01.290
P9: There are two different vasculitis possible high probability and.

312
