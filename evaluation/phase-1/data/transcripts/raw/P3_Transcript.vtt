00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.349
MODERATOR: And now you should be able to start reading the tasks and to move the mouse around around the screen.

2
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.500
P3: So what you see on your screen or two panels with labels.

3
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.710
P3: Labels left panel and main panel okay read the text within home.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.870
P3: out loud.

5
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:38.610
P3: An explorer as a source of your choosing by right clicking and opening a new tab once you feel you understand where the data comes from please click the button open map.

6
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:50.790
P3: To visualize the density of data points within the locations of interest he will be done when you mentioned a few of the locations of interest that have data points available okay so.

7
00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:05.010
P3: To see dashboards hide the complex seeds in making clinical rare disease data with environmental observations using knowledge graph the desired outcome is to support health data researches.

8
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:17.310
P3: identify appropriate environmental variables, to enable that hypothesis exploration and researching rare diseases Okay, how to use the dashboard select and submit the query inputs on the left.

9
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:30.540
P3: explore the resulting linked environmental data here after clicking submit export the data for your needs a text file named user query history is automatically saved in the.

10
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.750
P3: Local folder with the history of your query input selections you will be able to use this file to get the data directly through an API in the future.

11
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:59.730
P3: Data environmental observations have been gathered from weather pollution and aerosol data right click and open in a new tab data points density check the button and hover over the region to get the number of data points okay so rare disease uncut event of interest.

12
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.210
MODERATOR: So Would you mind for us finishing task one.

13
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.240
P3: task one oh right sorry.

14
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.440

yep.

18
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.780
P3: Is this the actual sources that you plan to use or is this just a domain.

19
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:50.940
P3: Oh, you can't tell me okay air quality that I EPA interesting I actually always wondered whether the air indexes are accurate and my dad was like Jim you know you want your environment till research I think thing I you smoke, it is like yeah I know my thought already.

20
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.680
P3: And then error cell from error net so interesting not heard of that one nothing.

21
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.360
P3: OK back to the dash and then.

22
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.510
P3: When you understand.

23
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.280
P3: click open map.

24
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.110
P3: Okay.

25
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.710
P3: Well, I get where they're coming from to open them up oh and look at the knife map.

26
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.780
P3: So now, I want to get your arm and so.

27
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.780
MODERATOR: I think that's because of the live chat.

28
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.690
MODERATOR: Let me, let me fix it.

29
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.670

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.370
P3: Changing I don't see my mouse doesn't seem to be interacting with it.

33
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.550
MODERATOR: Okay, maybe you need to click again some window.

34
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.020
Okay.

35
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.050
P3: So go away population one.

36
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.380
P3: Whether to data density points three So what does that mean.

37
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.660
P3: The populations here whether their.

38
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.460
P3: Population tree population tree whether they're.

39
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.340
P3: So what does this mean the number of ideas that you have with the number of.

40
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.850
MODERATOR: Make sure you read the names correctly Jim.

41
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.940
P3: county pollution weather and data density data points density.

42
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.230
P3: So does that mean there are four stations in Tipperary, that are contributing to the data.

43
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.620
P3: Oh, you can't tell me right.

44
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.530
P3: density of days is like within the location of.

45
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.500
P3: Three people in Galway that have.

46
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.950
P3: Data on pollution and whether or is it put the three.

47
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.270
P3: sources of pollution and weather data in going.

48
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.730
MODERATOR: It will be the second.

49
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.860
P3: Okay well that's not very clear, so I would just make up.

50
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.130
Your.

51
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.090
P3: Okay, am I doing with exercise one.

52
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.240
P3: She know what this is like it's like being in and he knows, have you done the gains for why do you have to like figure out the puzzle before you can be.

53
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.940
P3: Here, like yeah I know i'm serving you, but I can't tell you anything.

54
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.550
MODERATOR: Exactly.

55
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.620
P3: Okay right.

56
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.460
P3: i'm not a shark today i'm pretty tired.

57
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.150
P3: query using the input.

58
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.910
P3: options available in the query top.

59
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.020
P3: My connection is unstable it tells me.

60
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.350
P3: i'm trying to get there, we are okay so i'm in the query top.

61
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:48.630
P3: While you are selecting the query options, please explain the specific choices that you're making as you make choices new ones will be available, once you read the end, please click submit.

62
00:06:49.710 --> 00:07:09.240
P3: which will be only which will only be available if valid points have been selected, you will be done when a new top named Q one is displayed in the main panel at the dashboard okay so i'm interested in i'm Kurt yes event of interest let's go with definite location.

63
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.520
P3: He.

64
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.430
P3: invented interest dates.

65
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.450
P3: Okay, so these are all the date.

66
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:25.080
P3: In various counties, that would be will be have a document flair.

67
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.720
P3: So let's go with Dublin because there's going to be more there.

68
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.530
P3: And it's obviously in Ireland.

69
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.860
P3: Do you really have to click on and like it.

70
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.430
MODERATOR: is for the whole for the whole country, so all right.

71
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.500
P3: All right, Okay, well, I would maybe have brackets click here, if you want the whole country.

72
00:07:52.590 --> 00:08:01.440
P3: But, in general, what kind of probably want the whole country you know, because you own the dope lemon court cup like high density of cases.

73
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.670
P3: still confused by this data points density thing it looks to me like Cork in Dublin are.

74
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:26.310
P3: have more data density points in the rest of the country, but I don't imagine they have more weather or pollution stations, I think it's just that there's more occupations in those counties.

75
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.620
MODERATOR: it's a stations.

76
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:38.190
P3: Really, so they have more stations that is interesting, I wonder why that is anyway let's look from.

77
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.920
P3: The first of August.

78
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.520
P3: The maximum seem to be cooperating.

79
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.860
P3: Okay let's go with the 15th of August, then, to the.

80
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.680
P3: right one, maybe.

81
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.990
P3: Three months.

82
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.570
P3: let's do that.

83
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.490
P3: And I want both whether i'm creation and I want it in.

84
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.470
P3: So.

85
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.960
P3: i'm looking for the data that relates to definite flares.

86
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.610
P3: Between these dates for both whether i'm pollution.

87
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.540
P3: I mean you given me the let's say monthly.

88
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.830
P3: data for each variable per ID.

89
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:52.410
P3: For that month or the third presumably the date refers to the date that they had a definite flare, so I would want like a month.

90
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.400
P3: or two months or three months or four months or five months or six months.

91
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.080
P3: of data of each variable prior to that flatter.

92
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:11.580
P3: And I want to be able to aggregate there by daily average monthly up probably monthly average.

93
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:13.950
P3: and

94
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:27.570
P3: be able to compare the monthly average let's say in the month leading up to that date, compared to the three months prior to that date So what is this telling me.

95
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.070
MODERATOR: Just straight to move forward.

96
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.420
Okay.

97
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:48.120
P3: So let's go with monthly, although I don't know what month are you giving me I want the mean usually but I, like the fact that there's a Min and Max.

98
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:51.870
P3: Okay.

99
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.000
P3: So.

100
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.940
P3: I still don't really know what it's given me but anyway we'll see what comes up with.

101
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.670
P3: I like where you're going with it there.

102
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:14.490
P3: This is what I would plan to do in fact I was thinking of how to aggregate this data from the raw data dump that out, someone give me.

103
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.930
P3: But also, what I want is.

104
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:34.500
P3: So I want to look at let's say the monthly averages prior to be the basket like flares well i'd also want to be able to pull a different date that they were in remission.

105
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.750
P3: Okay, all the data.

106
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.650
Around.

107
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.610
P3: am I talking too much.

108
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.150
MODERATOR: No that's perfect like the more the better for me to just do.

109
00:11:46.770 --> 00:12:03.210
P3: Like, for example, and it's quite difficult for you to pick out a random date of permission so i've managed to do a code that does that so i'd want to be able to input dates that I want the data prior to.

110
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:12.630
P3: yeah and i'd want to be able to let say uplift a csv file to say for these ideas and these dates get me the data prior to that.

111
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:21.420
P3: OK OK so here anyway, I have month eight 910 in 2020 and a half the average.

112
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.790
P3: Rain temperature.

113
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:25.950
P3: We.

114
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.840
P3: Can we click on it wet cold air temperature.

115
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.900
P3: Oh, that doesn't the other way around.

116
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.650
P3: EP vapor pressure.

117
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.990
MODERATOR: Do you want, do you want to go pocket fitting the task.

118
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.330
P3: Oh right, I was on task number two.

119
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.130
P3: Oh, and this is it explore the query one top.

120
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.320
P3: query.

121
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.390
P3: No, I didn't see q1 anywhere but that might because of my.

122
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.030
P3: My oh there we go.

123
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:37.950
P3: So the full name of the variables, with the units appear when hovering over the headings table yeah for further information, please refresh the data sources links in the home tab which I had a look at the toggle call us button allows to select allows you to select the columns of interest.

124
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:50.430
P3: And the export button to download the data as a csv file to your computer only the visible columns will be downloaded so I presume this circle, with the line triggers are.

125
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.350
P3: likely to delete that column would that be right.

126
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.680
P3: These circles that I was clicking I obviously with deleting those columns.

127
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.400
P3: it's not right.

128
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:15.780
P3: So I would have someone like notification of what they bought means I mean from clicking it looks like it means delete.

129
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.430
P3: But that's not a parent until i've deleted it.

130
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.860
P3: And neither toggle.

131
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:33.990
P3: Okay, and so you can click here as well, right well let's say I want brain temperature.

132
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.740
P3: was very fast moving.

133
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.990
P3: So, like a preview.

134
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.560
P3: semi.

135
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.300
P3: Maybe i'll do that for free.

136
00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.740
P3: So this is the ability now.

137
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:08.220
P3: I see like might yeah I don't mind PM to five, even though that but, like 25.

138
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:21.000
P3: nights to that side Oh, we have suffered outside that's exciting, so you know the UK people find that soft outside of maybe suggestive interior design concept.

139
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.100
P3: You need that right.

140
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:34.860
P3: and carbon monoxide okay anyway i'm cutting off the point in order to understand the table, there are two buttons that help you interpret data table click both buttons on top.

141
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.550
P3: Open query input summary.

142
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.640
P3: So that tells me what query I made right.

143
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.320
P3: and open color table description.

144
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:16.500
P3: to your colors data table background if data is normally distributed know five Central be between the aca and then the value is greater than two are high and okay great What about if they're not normally distributed which i'm sure, a lot of the data.

145
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.260
P3: Especially if you're looking at clinical data, a lot of it will be not normally distributed.

146
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.740
P3: then read the text and the data okay did that and.

147
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.650
P3: Talk through the interpretation of the variables and the cell background colors.

148
00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:54.510
P3: off the table, you can select the columns that you want to display with the toggle columns okay know that you can scroll vertically and horizontally, which i've been doing and using the page arrows on the bottom right hand corner okay.

149
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.110
P3: You scroll down anymore.

150
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.960
MODERATOR: that's that's for me.

151
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.860
Right.

152
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.810
P3: and

153
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.610
P3: Does it scroll down more for my at the bottom of the page.

154
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.020
MODERATOR: it's fine.

155
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.250
Okay.

156
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.360
P3: i'm trying to go.

157
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.630
P3: i'm gonna go across here.

158
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:27.720
P3: me.

159
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:48.630
P3: Okay, so I can just see white background, so I presume that means everything's within its normal distribution the 95% confidence interval.

160
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.280
P3: And then.

161
00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:02.610
P3: I still i'm not sure so let's take rain in August 20 the average.

162
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:10.380
P3: monthly so with that the month of August was Point two.

163
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.240
P3: And that relates to Dublin.

164
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.950
P3: So all the ideas that have lyrics.

165
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.140
P3: That doesn't make sense, then, because.

166
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.100
P3: It doesn't match up with the dates of the.

167
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.450
P3: Air like what I want is for each ID.

168
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:42.180
P3: player date I want aggregated data for every month prior to that flare for like six or 12 months.

169
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.850
P3: Whereas this i'm getting.

170
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.830
P3: A random date range that I put in there that doesn't actually equate to the flare dates at all is that right.

171
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.770
MODERATOR: yeah I need to prove it in the next one.

172
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.300
P3: Okay um no.

173
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:15.660
P3: I think, especially at this table so explore the other tabs beside the jury should have all three are interactive with features for different purposes.

174
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:28.620
P3: Please use those features for each pot, while mentioning the usefulness of each one in understanding the environmental data you'll be done when you have explored through the interactive features for each Okay, so that first time series.

175
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:38.100
P3: So time series plot visual story along time visual story a long time that sounds odd.

176
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:59.460
P3: But I know what you mean the visualization of interactive plot zoo harbor pan and download legend click the variable to D select and Double Click to select ranger slider click and drag to select the period of interest on the bottom plot.

177
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.950
P3: The best runs from August to November ish.

178
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.260
P3: And the value is 02 minus one or plus one so it's I preview standardized data.

179
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.230
P3: What kind of foundation standardization, is it doing.

180
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:40.170
P3: I know there's various types, because I looked at these kind of these called parallel plots and in our before, and they were all doing very standard ization so i'd like to know what so then let's say we want to take out a few so i'm taking a temperature no let's give them the temperature.

181
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.460
P3: doesn't seem to be a Double Click it seems we have click or not correct so.

182
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.830
P3: leave him rain and temperature to cope what be.

183
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:14.340
P3: Okay, this is your shoulder to see like visually is there a relationship between things.

184
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.790
P3: But again you're comparing like.

185
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:34.620
P3: A time and relax versus the time and not relapse and while here, you might be able to look at all the patients together and see like his brain full way down here for all the patients.

186
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:51.210
P3: But if we're looking to compare a patient to themselves, you don't want a plot of their relapse versus a plot of their permission, you know just by by side, but also, you need to standardize.

187
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.550
P3: The.

188
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:54.780
Plus.

189
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.120
P3: like this.

190
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:10.020
P3: confused that we're looking at this doesn't relate to any patient this stuff related to a period of time, so like where is the flare on this plot, you know it should really be.

191
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.570
P3: flare is here.

192
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.910
P3: and

193
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.790
P3: Then, so we know where the floor is tuner.

194
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.810
P3: And then.

195
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.600
P3: If we're trying to look at a load of people together, then.

196
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:41.070
P3: Like How would you visualize because at the minute we're looking in theory at just one patients data right because it's people in Dublin, for example.

197
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:48.240
P3: So, in order to see a consistent POPs in and multiple people over time.

198
00:22:49.710 --> 00:23:00.810
P3: You almost need to parallel plot all the people who are having a flare and have flare at time zero, and then the average of.

199
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.460
MODERATOR: All the variables yep yep.

200
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.740
P3: I would think.

201
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.490
yep.

202
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:13.860
P3: um, but it is interesting to see how things change but it's how they changed in relation to the event so.

203
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:23.430
P3: Here you've got a nice idea of how things are going, but not how they relate anyway box plot.

204
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:38.190
P3: The box bones the into courses range divided by the media and.

205
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:49.020
P3: Two piece style whiskers they're called extended to a maximum of 1.5 times the into a quarter mile range beyond the box.

206
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:56.730
P3: I thought that the whiskers where the maximum the men, and this was the medium and then this.

207
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.440
P3: would sit back and 25.

208
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:20.910
P3: Okay, the visualization is interactive plops through hover COM and download so we're looking at the variable here and the value again standardize, so this is just showing us the distribution of each variable is that right.

209
00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.370
P3: um.

210
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.620
P3: Which.

211
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.180
P3: i'm not sure if that useful to have that standardized because.

212
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.830
P3: Like would you not really want to see what the actual absolute values are.

213
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.790
MODERATOR: You seeing the following tasks.

214
00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.200
Okay.

215
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.360
P3: I mean what does this tell me that there is.

216
00:24:49.440 --> 00:25:04.800
P3: Like I don't know what the entire quarter ranges for each variable so the absolute Barry ation might be quite small or it might be quite big so i'm not really sure what the benefit of his club is.

217
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:05.640
So.

218
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.560
P3: i'm hovering over giving me.

219
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:20.220
P3: A median men, you see your point in the Min and Max here is that not true.

220
00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.150
P3: But you told me the whiskers.

221
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.000
P3: relate to something else.

222
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.630
MODERATOR: will come this comes in later.

223
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.120
P3: Okay, and.

224
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.950
P3: I like the way Oh, but it's still standardized.

225
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:46.530
P3: Okay i'd be interested to know what i'm supposed to get out of the plot anyway we'll move on to polar plot.

226
00:25:49.650 --> 00:26:03.630
P3: This scatter polar plots complex variable wind dependencies the radius length indicates the wind speed on the direction of the wind direction and the degrees their wins and their degrees off winder actually.

227
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.320
P3: The visualization is interactive okay.

228
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.690
P3: select.

229
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.590
P3: Left look at the rain.

230
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.300
P3: and

231
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.040
P3: Wind the wind direction rain.

232
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:28.710
P3: rain.

233
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.440
P3: Okay So what does it mean.

234
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:49.740
P3: The radius lead indicates the wind speed Okay, so I can see the wind speed on the direction, but what does this relate to when does this.

235
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.010
P3: relate to who does it relate to.

236
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.850
P3: And what relevance is the rain.

237
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.540
P3: Again i'm not sure how this person on devices.

238
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.690
P3: I might be wrong.

239
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:11.610
MODERATOR: For you.

240
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:22.320
P3: Might finish now again I don't see any different colors so this almost be 95%.

241
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.650
P3: there's something outside of be.

242
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.580
P3: Oh, maybe that's just the data table.

243
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.440
P3: I think I should move on to Question five is that right.

244
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:55.440
P3: yep create two new queries so that's over here after you have submitted them following the same instructions and step two, you will see q2 q3 of new panels Now you can compare them in the comparative top read the text in this top.

245
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:06.750
P3: number of groups, you wish to Mike and click on click to generate groups and you input or group will appear on to me.

246
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.090
P3: Okay i'm going to start with long.

247
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:24.120
P3: So can I refresh it no, I have to click through it okay so that's the same let's stay with jack but let's go to.

248
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.120
P3: All.

249
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.400
P3: go away we'll go.

250
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.810
MODERATOR: Island selected again.

251
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.640
P3: Okay.

252
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.150
P3: i'll try and.

253
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.590
P3: go from the second.

254
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.780
P3: To.

255
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.580
P3: And let's just go with less time and I want.

256
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:12.510
P3: parent be enough telling me pollution varies quite a lot over the day across season so it's better to go abroad or average he was saying so let's go with monthly.

257
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:23.190
P3: But again i'm picking a date range that doesn't relate to people at all so i'm not sure how those two up and i'm going to submit.

258
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.240
P3: Okay, so there's actually not much data here.

259
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.260
P3: So delete the ones that.

260
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.740
P3: We have no data for And why is that.

261
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.650
P3: Something like this, so we only have ozone to go away.

262
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:53.970
P3: And then I need to do it again so let's go for Cork, this time.

263
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.430
P3: and

264
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.920
P3: Okay, more data here.

265
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:39.000
P3: I can't scroll across lots of all the data we have okay so then i'm going to comparative query data previously submitted in the session can be compared by specific variable.

266
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:51.990
P3: He can combine these queries into groups with the multiple selection inputs to potentially increase the signal to noise ratio decide the number of groups that we wish to compare.

267
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.180
P3: select which queries he wants to.

268
00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:09.420
P3: explore each environment variable with different plots queries are grouped by confusion, the mean per unit of time in time series plot by come fascinating the valleys in the box.

269
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.550
P3: Okay, all right.

270
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.070
P3: But let's go back to go.

271
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.730
P3: to generate groups.

272
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.640
P3: group one.

273
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.340
P3: Okay, so you can compare different places.

274
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.160
P3: So what would actually make more sense if you will compare time points.

275
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.510
P3: So, like definite versus permission.

276
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.070
P3: For the individuals or for.

277
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.210
P3: A standardized.

278
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.970
P3: variable for each individual indefinite versus permission, maybe.

279
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.380
P3: range of queries.

280
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:15.780
P3: click.

281
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.860
P3: Oh wait for the groups in there, the queries.

282
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:35.580
P3: read the text that's left the number of groups three then click on generate groups which we did.

283
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.800
P3: A range of queries in the groups and click on click plot.

284
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:51.600
P3: Their sub tubs will have appeared with three different visualizations pays mentioned and usefulness.

285
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.520
P3: or not come with the rain.

286
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.540
P3: callback error update on.

287
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.520
MODERATOR: That that's let's.

288
00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.320
MODERATOR: keep going.

289
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:21.360
P3: So I have no plot there Oh, because I compare it pollution, so I need.

290
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.250
P3: Some latent variable and there was only one there, and one of them.

291
00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.590
P3: Okay i'm looking in there either.

292
00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.450
P3: box.

293
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.760
P3: temperature.

294
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.380
P3: Because it's just the group.

295
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.410
P3: So let's go with my age.

296
00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.240
P3: But I thought there was another.

297
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.010
P3: variation variable it's why we haven't seen a great.

298
00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.330
P3: i'm pretty sure i'm for examples and all of them.

299
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.900
P3: So it was Dublin Galway Cork.

300
00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:25.980
P3: So ozone is higher in Galway in the period of automatic thing.

301
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:36.150
P3: So what would be more useful is if this variable higher or lower in different disease activity states.

302
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.810
P3: Actually, that will be very useful okay.

303
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:47.700
P3: Because in essence that's what we're trying to see.

304
00:34:49.830 --> 00:35:01.920
P3: cuz because it's not we don't have enough people in each county to compare let's face the onset of anchor in Galway vs core because that heavily dependent on.

305
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:16.590
P3: The fact that we're all based in Dublin so more people get diagnosed up here and where this kind of thing will be useful, is an equinox kind of thing where you're comparing on code yes versus a control.

306
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:27.330
P3: Whereas we have to compare between the individual because we have only anka compared to nothing, so we have to compare relapse and remission.

307
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.250
P3: Okay, so I see where you go with the box and then the distance.

308
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.770
P3: Yes, try ozone again seeing that we know exists.

309
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.260
P3: Right.

310
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:44.820
P3: me.

311
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.890
P3: Some labels on this graph will be.

312
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.480
P3: different from what.

313
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.210
P3: So with these coordinates.

314
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:10.890
P3: No.

315
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.640
P3: absolutely no idea what this ground.

316
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.470
P3: And the time series.

317
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.720
P3: is still seem to want to work for me doesn't.

318
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.850
MODERATOR: Think it's it broke.

319
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.930
Oh.

320
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.140
P3: So I move on.

321
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.100
MODERATOR: Yes, please.

322
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.030
Okay.

323
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.550
P3: choose one of the queries to export, so we will export very one.

324
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:55.140
P3: I do, like the idea of being able to compare them so but, as I say, I think it's primarily comparing within so query one go to that tab and click export.

325
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.660
P3: Export there we are okay.

326
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.260
MODERATOR: Let me close it otherwise you don't have to worry to my computer okay.

327
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.480
P3: Finally, civic download on the Left panel and click download.

328
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:35.700
P3: With all.

329
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:04.890
P3: So, presumably the data is stored in my local folder or something.

330
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.300
MODERATOR: It now it's in mind.

331
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:22.710
P3: Okay, and finally, could you summarize verbally your overall experience in completing these tasks, then please proceed to complete the questionnaire, well, I thought the tasks are very easy to understand.

332
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.550
P3: The dashboard is relatively easy to go than the things that I mentioned already um.

333
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.920
P3: Well, as I said, the outcome is where I would adjust.

334
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:37.950
P3: And also.

335
00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.650
P3: You want to be able to compare.

336
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.140
P3: Like, for example, we don't know, is it.

337
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:51.780
P3: sulfur dioxide.

338
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.670
P3: In the.

339
00:38:54.870 --> 00:39:11.490
P3: Sixth, month prior to the flare or is it the sulfur dioxide average over the last 654 months prior to flare so it will be helpful to have like loads of different options to compare.

340
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.870
P3: And ultimately yeah compare like point zero is the date.

341
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:34.050
P3: relapse or remission and what does the standardized variable look like prior to that dates.

342
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:47.730
P3: Because we're not called with my uvb analysis we imagine that the uvb was going to be much higher in remission been a relapse So if I was looking at that visually.

343
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:52.110
P3: I might have it relapse graph down here.

344
00:39:53.250 --> 00:40:06.090
P3: On a readmission appear, or it could be on the same graph in different colors and you know you could be here for one stage of setup here for the other, but you know it has to be centered at zero for the event.

345
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.120
P3: Have I performed well yeah.

346
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.210
MODERATOR: i'm gonna stop the recording.

347
00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.080
Okay.
