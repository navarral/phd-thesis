00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.600
MODERATOR: Now i'm going to give you a remote control.

2
00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.309
MODERATOR: And now you should be able to start reading.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.500
P2: The tasks okay so.

4
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.440
MODERATOR: If you want to read it out loud maybe makes it easier.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.160
P2: Okay section submit the query inputs on the left.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.140
P2: Here explore the resulting linked environmental data that appear after keeping submissions you submit button God.

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.720
MODERATOR: that's tasks to you should start in task, one which starts with.

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.990
P2: Oh sorry i'm reading what i'm reading what's on your screen.

9
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.730
P2: But you want me to go back to my.

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.810
MODERATOR: or sorry yes.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:56.130
P2: Okay, fair enough Okay, and so that's 20 what you see on the screen two panels that amendment read the text within home tab main are allowed and all sorts of your choosing budget right clicking dropping it.

12
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.650
P2: In a new tab explore data source of a choice choose an open in a new tab once you feel yourself whether it comes from click to.

13
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:22.770
P2: Open up to visualize the density of data points within the equations of interest will be done when you mentioned a few of the otherwise that have data points available okay back to zoom a home i'm going home, and so I have to.

14
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.370
P2: find a data set of interest, so I think i'm just going to open this Oh, I see no data, whether no and.

15
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.730
P2: So there was something that right clicking i'll have to go back sorry not having two screens going to slow this down a bit and.

16
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:50.520
P2: read the text known to man, I think I read already explored a data source of your choosing by right clicking and opening is in a new tab okay i'll try again as a data set of your choosing.

17
00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:03.810
P2: And there are data sources temporal Is that what you mean data temple units chase visualization I don't know if those are what you mean by data sets of my choosing.

18
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:17.010
P2: and David Robinson government funding sources and so sorry i'll have to go back here again, but I suspect that there's a mismatch between what i'm reading here.

19
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.970
P2: In task one and, once you figure this out the data comes from now so.

20
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.950
P2: Right clicking so explore add data source of your choosing by right clicking audacious source, yes I have it now okay sorry I didn't read properly first time.

21
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.050
P2: So a data source and their traditional sources temporary minutes and spatial gentle obligation, or I don't know if you mean these ones, so I think i'll try these ones.

22
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.940
P2: Now that doesn't right click of course my most might not right click just because yours does.

23
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.250
MODERATOR: Controlling the screen.

24
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.140
P2: I have.

25
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.090
P2: A I have a mouse moving around here on the screen, I thought it was working.

26
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.420
P2: It says i'm you are controlling it, go to the screen.

27
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.820
MODERATOR: Okay, can you move it because I don't see it moving.

28
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.590
P2: I can.

29
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.570
MODERATOR: Do yes, yes perfect perfect sorry.

30
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.450
P2: Ah, now it's now it's saving differently right i'm getting a but I don't know what right clicking does okay so i'm going to try, whether.

31
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:24.060
P2: Open link in new tab open Lincoln new window open link and private window and I guess, we could open a new tab.

32
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.850
P2: Will I be able to see that.

33
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.850
P2: yeah okay.

34
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.460
P2: So.

35
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.580
P2: Okay, and that's not your fault, I understand that that's because of the lag.

36
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:54.360
P2: Okay, and allow don't allow that's you don't know want me to do i'm going to say don't flop Okay, so we can go in here, and I can look in this region and find data and find more data.

37
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.690
P2: And and.

38
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.560
P2: Okay, and when I get to hear that's the solid gap, I can find blah blah blah.

39
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.190
P2: 30 are averages okay.

40
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.900
P2: whoo whoo.

41
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.880
P2: Okay, not sure he wanted me to go there and.

42
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.910
MODERATOR: know it just for you to understand where the data comes from that.

43
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.150
yeah.

44
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.030
P2: it's coming from Aaron okay.

45
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:42.840
P2: We won't accept all cookies I think I knew that anyway alright so i'm going to abandon I gotta go back to here for now and pollution well I love it well, you probably don't miss out Okay, so let me go back to the task.

46
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.080
P2: This would be easier if we were doing.

47
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.860
P2: In a place where you could set it up for me.

48
00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:00.900
P2: With multiple screens Okay, so I understood open map visual identity response locations, you will be done when you mention a few of the noi set of data points available, I said Sally gap so you'll be large but that right okay.

49
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:09.600
P2: submit a query using input options available the creator on the left, most panel, while you're selecting the query options, please explain about the specific choice to make.

50
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:22.410
P2: let's make choices new ones will become available, just like once you reach the employees click submit button once which will only be very valuable to be selected we don't want new tab name qr is displayed in main panel up the dashboard please only submit one query okay.

51
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.250
MODERATOR: I don't want to interrupt you, but you mean the last part of the first task.

52
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.000
Oh.

53
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.220
P2: You were.

54
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:38.490
P2: Okay, once you feel you've answered the critical critical open map oh to visualize data points of did I not opening them up soon okay all right.

55
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.010
P2: Well yeah this one try.

56
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.980
P2: Okay, I thought you wanted me to look at the.

57
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.570
P2: Come on, open them up oh there it is.

58
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.970
P2: Okay.

59
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.460
P2: Okay, and so this is where you wanted me to look at the data, the density of data points okay.

60
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.540
P2: find a way to get closer.

61
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.840
P2: clicking on this map isn't doing anything which I was hoping.

62
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.270
P2: there's a plus button, there are see now.

63
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.110
P2: Okay, and.

64
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.830
P2: The number of data points Okay, so in County West me that we have to population pollution records one weather record.

65
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.170
P2: And Okay, and in Dublin, we have 27 pollution records and three weather records okay.

66
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.530
P2: The data points density i'm not sure if I know what that means, but am 27 plus three is 30 that's what's going on there okay.

67
00:06:49.980 --> 00:07:03.600
P2: And if I click back here yeah okay that makes sense sorry yep I did miss that task and Okay, so I need to go back one oh no it's it just opened them up OK, so now i'm going to go and do I think I had finished reading the query.

68
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:14.820
P2: yeah so my most decides changes in mind about whether it wants to be impacting on your screen and off everybody, we are OK query so.

69
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:26.280
P2: I read, most of the thing no I read all the way to the bottom, on that one okay so and i'm interested in a rare disease, perhaps Okay, the only disease in here is like a basket I just fair enough.

70
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:38.790
P2: And i'm interested in different flares high probability flares possible flares are no fillers let's say high probability flares because I know there aren't very many flowers.

71
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:54.210
P2: So, and now what I don't know from this is where the data includes high probability and above or just high probability only and which is something that might be worth being able to understand better and then I have.

72
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.130
P2: and

73
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.950
P2: you've given me some information about what's.

74
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:08.340
P2: available, so I presume that somebody in Carlo huddle high probability flair on the 21st of September 2017.

75
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:16.140
P2: Okay, but I think you told me that you only 320 20 days deep data but that's okay all right, and I could look at more of these if I wanted to.

76
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:30.630
P2: have lots of Dublin ones okay fair enough and i'm going to select Dublin because there's loads of cases there might want to select multiple more than one not sure if that's possible, let me have a look sounds like Dublin anyway.

77
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:38.940
P2: A workaholic oriented get all violent, but let me stick with Dublin date range i'm going to.

78
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.640
P2: pick first June.

79
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.100
P2: Hello.

80
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:59.460
P2: whoops and first of June that worked okay and i'll go to the end of 2020 you told me already had a French 20s and the writer.

81
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.530
P2: 31st of December is.

82
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.890
P2: not available.

83
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:21.210
P2: Okay 30th of December okay and data sources, whether or pollution, I guess i'll go for pollution is quite a lot of pollution records in Dublin and and.

84
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:28.350
P2: Okay, so do I want hourly pollution records daily blues records monthly.

85
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.100
P2: Publication records, I guess, on wondering when I read that is our average over the month.

86
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:45.210
P2: And how are these the hopper even mean to get our pollution record by the hour, but a lot of data so i'll go with daily for now and and.

87
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:56.070
P2: spatial temporal aggregation I know what that means, but I guess, not everybody in the world would and and I go to the mean the map domain, or should I go with the Max because that's kind of interesting.

88
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.520
P2: And i'll submission.

89
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.080
P2: hit submit I think yeah good.

90
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.330
P2: Okay, so some data has come back and nine different.

91
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.070
P2: windows servers and looks to me like.

92
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.810
P2: yep there we go Okay, I was having some trouble getting into scroll.

93
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:35.430
P2: Okay, and alright so and here's the output data, and I think I was who's that task on a hit submit and we go back to the tasks.

94
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:55.440
P2: And my acrobat reader and so you'll be done when a new job Thank you want to space maintenance okay did that looks great okay explore the q1 tab in order to the template underneath there are two buttons or have you interpretation that you see click both buttons on top.

95
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:03.990
P2: and open query input summary and open color table description commenting on a useless and clarity explanations okay.

96
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:12.120
P2: then read the text in the data sub tab and talk to the interpretation variables and sell background color is red and blue data.

97
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.640
P2: You can set the columns you want to display with the toggle columns and not that you can scroll vertically horizontally and use the page arrows.

98
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:25.140
P2: To check meditation jquery by scrolling you were done when you figure sufficient exports table Okay, so I got explore what are the two things.

99
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:35.610
P2: clipboard buttons at the top, read the text in the data sub tab and talk to the interpretation variables and circular backgrounds okay so back to zoom.

100
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.840
P2: And so, this button, or just not clicking on other ago and.

101
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.890
P2: is telling me that I, this is what the date, this is the query data issue basically.

102
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:58.950
P2: I don't know why it has the word open in front of me that's not clear to me what that means, but query input summary maybe makes more sense so that's me could think about.

103
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:12.000
P2: So I picked out of I started with high probability and Dublin an iPad pollution data and as a second page of this apparently or had to do with the data, presumably and.

104
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:23.520
P2: it's not going to the second page but that's probably a delay problem like imagine if I did, it will be telling me the date range or PICs on prepared.

105
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:30.150
P2: Okay sliding over the place, oh yeah and the other things I picked cool OK, and then.

106
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:38.340
P2: Again I don't grow the word open means there but that's Okay, and if there is no mystery 95% should be between.

107
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:57.060
P2: minus two and two that's course and it will be quite if the value is greater than to be read and it's less than minus two would be okay that makes sense of the word, three colors in the stuff when I look at it Okay, I wonder, can I close these again our water just scrolled away.

108
00:12:59.220 --> 00:12:59.730
P2: Okay.

109
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.990
P2: Okay, so I did that job and then obviously the data table, which I think is this one here and yeah data.

110
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.290
P2: Top full name verbs with units appear when hovering over the headings of the data table oh cool that's good.

111
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:14.850
P2: cook.

112
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:30.330
P2: For opposite okay Emily please refer to the data source links in the home tab Wu Tang claims button allows you to select becomes interesting to export data Okay, so I could decide that i'm interested in and.

113
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:42.930
P2: or we're not doing talking, we were just exploring I think at this stage, and you didn't ask me to toggle things yeah as far as I remember, so we've got some data or maybe you did, let me go back and check what you asked me to do.

114
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:54.270
P2: And so, set called did you want to display oh yeah Okay, and then you can score too hard on the news page arms Okay, and I haven't found any red or blue.

115
00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:03.300
P2: Values everything's whites of ours for like a job, but I could go to different pages okay so okay there's a red one is you know, and so the so to.

116
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:29.730
P2: On the second of June and 2020 was out to the range cool as enough and PM 2.5 was above the range should have been a on the sixth of know on the 16th of that month cool okay so i'm going to just trying so if I toggle so toggling if I click that button that one goes away.

117
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:36.300
P2: And i'll get rid of some of these other ones, because there's too many going across the screen okay i'm not talking right place there.

118
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:46.200
P2: I want to keep someone's i've heard of before i've heard that one I know what seo is carbon monoxide very interesting and.

119
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.350
P2: I feel like okay so there's.

120
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.760
P2: The can tell if they're more columns and my scraper to.

121
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.410
P2: guess the right because they were getting wider where they, as I was.

122
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.430
P2: As I was.

123
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:09.510
P2: Getting rid of them okay so i've got the day the month the year I know the year so i'm wondering to hide that now because that's not much used to it.

124
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:21.150
P2: So now God month day PM to 1pm 25 nitrogen dioxide and so toolkit all looks fine and I have.

125
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.430
P2: Lots of values and it's got to be loads because I.

126
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:40.710
P2: Because I selected a long period of time, so there's another company blues yeah should be nice to see some blues but we'll keep going Okay, I can scroll up and down the page give nicer with a big screen and.

127
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:42.510
P2: move up and down.

128
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.550
P2: Okay, so there's a pink one we'd I wasn't anticipating a pink value and.

129
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:57.660
P2: Because yeah I don't know what the right value means but that's good maybe I clicked there tonight or problems.

130
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:08.970
P2: Okay, fair enough, I didn't notice it's a bit slow be so hard workouts going on there's also a funny just where I wanted to push here there's a blue you probably can't see it but there's a blue.

131
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.620
MODERATOR: Account that's for.

132
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.760
P2: Monitoring our head.

133
00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.880
MODERATOR: that's what it's for some admin stuff like.

134
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.830
P2: hey so it's just making it very hard to find the little arrow that I need, which is the.

135
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.490
P2: same for you okay i'm just gonna keep going and see what when any blues.

136
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.010
P2: And then I got to give up.

137
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:34.200
P2: I know I have to scroll a little bit slow anyway, I can tell that if I wanted to see every value of these things for all the dates that.

138
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.400
P2: I am now I toggle of side obviously did it i'd made a mistake here is I didn't want to change the offerings.

139
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:55.590
P2: Oh no I didn't want to that either now haha if I want to bring a call him back, how do I do that Oh, here we go good, so I want to come down to come back okay what I told him I do is to check because I seem to have I messed up the ordering.

140
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.350
P2: When I wasn't paying attention yeah and funny this one I can't.

141
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:08.160
P2: I can't see the one to change the month ordering so I don't know what does this digital enterprise problem.

142
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:16.050
P2: Air Okay, and of course that's Why would it would be interesting, why don't I do this now if because i'm interesting finding blue ones, if I did this.

143
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:29.340
P2: A it's going from our from low to high hopes crazy and and i'm on page six So if I were to go back to the first page.

144
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:37.260
P2: or low PM to VI VI us but they're not blue Okay, I was thinking, my friend blue one know blues there that's even when the blue ones here.

145
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:57.750
P2: and start going in order, I wanted to go in, yes oops so what i've learned here now is that the lowest no to in that six month period was on the seventh of know the fifth of July that's possibly conceivably useful sure Mrs water supply outside as well.

146
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.790
P2: And the 18th of July was the lowest so July was a good month.

147
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.810
P2: For pollution all right Okay, and I, if I can find the button to get to the end, I think this one's.

148
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:18.840
P2: Quite reaches Okay, I think i've done a really good job of exploring the data task list okay and.

149
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:31.200
P2: Vertical harder and you don't want to pet i've explored the table okay explore the other tabs beside the data tab all three plots sanctuaries box on polar polar interactive with features for different purposes, please use those huge problem mentioned users in each one i'm sorry.

150
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.360
P2: We don't when you export for the interactive features for each of the three tabs okay.

151
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.350
P2: So here's the question.

152
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.650
P2: yeah when I go off to my to find the document when I come back it's not all.

153
00:18:46.710 --> 00:19:02.190
P2: immediately and controlling your screen but i'm getting there now Okay, so I saw this earlier it here time series so now, this is where you need to sign a statistician rather than a computer scientist like okay that looks like something I can understand.

154
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.960
P2: And the things went up and down.

155
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:17.700
P2: it's including all of the variables, not just the ones that I shared churchill's or a lot okay and but perhaps I might want to remove some of them at some point anyway i'd be like to think.

156
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:28.830
P2: i'd like to think that July would look a little lower than some of the others, since we sold off when I was fiddling around and but there was a high honor that pipe him 25 was in.

157
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:36.720
P2: late June fair enough, and things are not so good, the beginning of August okay now apparently I can toggle things, so let me see.

158
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.890
P2: can remove that one possibly.

159
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:52.020
P2: A muted, on the other thing, and I can move this one, presumably so we'll get the similar view as I hadn't the other one, these are the three things I was interested in earlier.

160
00:19:52.590 --> 00:20:02.730
P2: Okay, and it's funny how what starts so two was high the beginning of November, as well as the beginning of August, with no good reason for that.

161
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:20.880
P2: And what the hell happened to PM 25 on that anyway, probably related to whether some of those things Okay, so I talked to those things that offers a little toggle so in here zoom out zoom okay zoom however single and multiple times and download was PNG so zoom.

162
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.000
P2: zoom.

163
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.150
P2: not sure how to zoom but.

164
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:38.820
P2: I might just be more patient or look into this sorry Okay, so now we're looking at.

165
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:59.190
P2: yeah okay just go to look at this end of November, whether these very high red ones and yep Okay, and some of those are very small and but show data set on show closed state of hover.

166
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:15.810
P2: i'm not sure whether that means oh yes Okay, yes, when i'm hovering on getting some information about their colo It makes sense okay and download as a PNG Am I gonna bother doing that and you've told me a can I guess it's one of these buttons here.

167
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:24.540
P2: Anyway, okay go ahead and click the variable to dislike to Double Click certainly i've done sort of selecting or I can do, select only if you want me to.

168
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.430
P2: Do who go.

169
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:33.690
P2: Okay, all right and range that I did that already okay cool so now i'm going to go to box plots.

170
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.550
P2: and

171
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:47.040
P2: So you asked me if I don't be a useful but, of course, since i'm not really somebody who does this kind of analysis or not it'll tell you much about you, so what I can tell you whether I can use us, which is, I think what you really aren't.

172
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:57.330
P2: Okay box plots Okay, so I do that recently about box plots, but I think we might do the same move some of these and.

173
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:09.540
P2: So I was kind of expecting to find the things down here that I use last time to get rid of ones that I didn't want and but that's okay and.

174
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.030
P2: And that's a little PM 25 so I might have to zoom let me see.

175
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:23.880
P2: Okay, and what that's done is hidden stuff smart daisy.

176
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.160
P2: Yes.

177
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.950
P2: Okay, I can't see the boss now so i'll just go back go back to where I was before.

178
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.910
P2: Okay they're all between two and minus two okay so i've explained why couldn't see them so i'm gonna try that one more time.

179
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.580
P2: Oh yeah because they're all centered around zero so it would be better if, when you did, that the.

180
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.170
P2: I can't make I can't make it damn.

181
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:58.260
MODERATOR: there's a button, that is, which is the Cross next magnifying glass.

182
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:12.150
P2: wasn't obvious to me Okay, and so now looking at I was trying to go to Gal stick to it, oh.

183
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:15.330
P2: Hello.

184
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.640
P2: Can you go back down there.

185
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:30.300
P2: Okay, and can I can know what's going to pan sideways so one thing that be might be interested to do is to be removed some of these things, probably doesn't say that I can you upload your zoom hover.

186
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.930
P2: hand and download okay So what did I do, I did hover hover.

187
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.470
P2: yeah upper lower no to Max did it up okay so there's more variability in.

188
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.750
P2: No to than in some of these other ones, this one's wasn't a much variability at all.

189
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.660
P2: And now I got the planning to work sideways.

190
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.260
P2: No, I don't think account so i'm going to.

191
00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:01.830
P2: Come back over here turn off the planning, but um yeah okay.

192
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.250
P2: Some of these problems is the delay.

193
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.030
P2: Okay, so CEO to CEO doesn't very much.

194
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.080
P2: You know, to varies quite a bit old tree where is more and.

195
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:26.370
P2: I can't get the thing to pounce on it all right that'll do for that one okay pull up I don't think I even know where to pull up clauses so that'll be interesting Oh yes, that makes sense for windows about direction but I didn't do wind so there's nothing to see here.

196
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:37.380
P2: That makes sense perfect and and if I did, I would be able to zoom hover pan okay so.

197
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:39.840
P2: I think I finished that task.

198
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.150
P2: yeah okay.

199
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:52.830
P2: So create to nuclear so i'll try to a weather query with some wind and the sun after you submit it and follow the same services and step two.

200
00:24:53.400 --> 00:25:03.570
P2: you'll see crust q2 q3 Now you can prepare them period of time okay read the Texans top a certain number of groups, you wish to make it very complicated and then click on.

201
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:09.840
P2: click to generate groups, a new inputs PR group will appear underneath okay.

202
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:19.200
P2: So i'm not sure if i'm going to order group is when we work with work away arrange a quiz into groups are you guys into groups and click on click to plot groups.

203
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:27.540
P2: Now, new sub have appeared three different visualizations please mentioned are these fuzzy on a certain amount of step three okay so we'll see what I can do.

204
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:41.940
P2: Right, so another query so to do anything comparative and useful, it would be clever to take the same patients that seems to me, and the same time period but get different different.

205
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.710
P2: Different data so i'm going to try and do that so.

206
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:58.410
P2: I presume on into clicking in here okay Hello i'm controlling your screen parenting okay so good, to go thank of US gliders i'm going to go with high probability i'm going to.

207
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:07.500
P2: Try and there we go got go Dublin i'm going to go with the same data rate date range but i'm going to put in whether.

208
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:18.210
P2: whoops whether or not pollution, and given that you told me that I was comparing.

209
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:36.840
P2: Not pollution Okay, and I guess I should so do daily and and I was getting the Max of the pollution variables across a day but sure why not get the mean of the weather pollution, the weather.

210
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:43.590
P2: data across the days Okay, and I got hit submit now unless you scream at me that i've done something stupid.

211
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.930
P2: So there we go.

212
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.060
P2: And I would.

213
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.370
P2: Think much more trauma Nice and soft something's happening cool.

214
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:07.770
P2: Okay, nine pages so that's it yeah because there's the same number of days, as it was before might have made my life easier if i'd gone with a smaller time time period but nevermind okay so.

215
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.700
P2: Okay, so okay.

216
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:25.740
P2: Comparative I think that's what i'm supposed to do next, this is query to just kind of a very quick locals We have lots and lots of variables and some of them are not very interesting, like the ones that are not brightly colored.

217
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.750
P2: what's our home.

218
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:37.410
P2: Relative humidity presumably and and so on, and that sun is more sun than usual, and this is less relative humidity.

219
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:53.940
P2: than usual okay alright, so I can see why it makes sense, this collaborative thing now okay comparative so we'll just review some of this discussion, and we compared by specific compared by specific variable okay so that's oh yeah so I could put and day and.

220
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.980
MODERATOR: you combine these queries in the owner with.

221
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.800
MODERATOR: The previous to have the same task because you missed.

222
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.930
MODERATOR: Can you should query two times so you have three queries to compare.

223
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.830
P2: Ah, OK.

224
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:20.580
P2: OK, and I just couldn't read this for a second right because you can squeeze in groups and multiple segments 2% increase in okay paired by specific variable okay i'm not sure how we're gonna do our groups Okay, so I have to make another one and.

225
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.930
P2: and

226
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.110
P2: Okay, so i'm suddenly wondering it So these are.

227
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.700
P2: These.

228
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:41.910
P2: yeah i'm not i'm certainly wondering what relevance to uncover and all this has to that's right all i'm getting here is.

229
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:50.700
P2: weather and pollution days deep data for every day for six months in Dublin and it's got nothing to do and seems to me with whether somebody gosh.

230
00:28:51.180 --> 00:29:00.780
P2: A vasculitis or not or had a high probability of flair or not i'm not sure i'm certainly not sure what that's all doing and in here and that's an issue because.

231
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:10.980
P2: I can compare whether pollution in other places I don't need to come here and you think, having listened to you for a long time in avert meetings that have some idea what that's doing but I.

232
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:19.320
P2: I don't because, as far as I can tell each record that i've been looking at is one day.

233
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:32.160
P2: And a day so i'm getting six months of of records, so I have no idea how that relates to a person with or without an ankle vasculitis okay anyway.

234
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:45.000
P2: persist here now what could I could conceivably want to compare and I can't think what i'm able to compare the weather in one settlements, with the weather and different settlements, maybe and.

235
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:59.340
P2: I can't I can't narrow down to particular data sources okay daily monthly yearly Max Max suppose I could put in a Max instead for this one.

236
00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.870
P2: Just.

237
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:09.480
P2: Not helps no at all and I can't see any reason to change any of this because I don't understand at all what this is doing.

238
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:17.940
P2: What I do these things are doing for me on I don't serve so from my perspective, all that stuff above there is not relevant because i'm basically getting.

239
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:27.900
P2: Whether inclusion data for Dublin for this for this for this range of dates Okay, and this time I got to go with whether again, but I got to get the Max whether I go into submission.

240
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:34.500
P2: submission.

241
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.180
P2: yeah.

242
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:55.200
P2: Okay, and so there are some yellow blue blue lomax I use for something here for some some variable I didn't find any blues here come on.

243
00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.110
P2: scroll up scroll down, please.

244
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:15.000
P2: Okay, too much of a lag and oops it's the wind direction, which is okay and that's different from all the kinds of ones okay and low relative relative humidity again in early June.

245
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.370
P2: Okay, so now i've done that now i've gone back to compare thing I think i'm a little bit out of my depth here now, this stage.

246
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:28.980
P2: So these are the number of groups, you wish to compare select which queries you want to group and explore each environment variable with the different plots.

247
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:41.610
P2: Chris Gruber computing the mean per unit of time in the time queries or group but computer mean per unit of time, as I mean as long and by capturing the values in the box and just.

248
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.810
P2: forgot where, despite his building okay i'm serious thought as a limitation combined queries with different time units okay.

249
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:58.140
P2: And query data previously submission this session can be compared by specific variable you can combine these queries into groups with the multiple selection inputs.

250
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.550
P2: To potentially increase the signal to noise ratio you combine these queries into groups of the most likely was.

251
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:16.830
P2: OK so i'm out of my depth here right i'm really don't understand why we want to do anything in groups because i'm not a i'm not a researcher and but I go to groups so that I have some chance to maybe keep tabs of what's going on.

252
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.410
P2: and

253
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.050
P2: and

254
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:31.980
P2: I am going to so sorry Okay, and then i'm going to say group one, so, if I remember correctly grew query one was a pollution one.

255
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.150
P2: and

256
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.650
P2: i'm going to compare that with he.

257
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.570
P2: With some other.

258
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.560
P2: Things you, all I can do so i'm going to do generation groups.

259
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.900
P2: On either that already, I think.

260
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.150
P2: You said it was a bit okay.

261
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:31.050
P2: select variables to compare groups elect to compare groups Okay, so I don't have those variables in my two things might be more sensible to do.

262
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:46.350
P2: To group, but there are both the same my data story matters and MINS okay so Max is no means an axis, so I won't have any variable costs to accept days and I don't know if you've got days in your last operating on the boys.

263
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.120
P2: Look.

264
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.450
P2: For msl.

265
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.340
P2: When speed when direction some.

266
00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:06.300
P2: I guess I could me see what i'm doing I could compare I could check I could maybe maybe that's what i'm supposed to do see if this PM 25.

267
00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:11.430
P2: Okay.

268
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:20.310
P2: So, as I said, i'm a bit lost so i'm going to try and i'm going to try and change this so that so that I can compare.

269
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.380
P2: The Max.

270
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:32.070
P2: have some pollution variable to the meanest some pollution variable if I think to this true now probably get it i'm going to i'm going to make this say am.

271
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.220
P2: I going to make this say q3 I think.

272
00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:02.760
P2: So i'm going to do group ones q3 so I don't I still, as I say, don't tell the group is and.

273
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:16.920
P2: And now I have at least gosh and so time series or, should I do time series now because I kind of understand what i'm doing and i'm going to look at.

274
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:25.800
P2: select a variable to compare the groups, so I can look at the, if I understand what's going on here correctly, I could take the temperature here.

275
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:43.140
P2: And the red one is the mean and the blue one is the Max so i'm able to see that can compare the main in the Max of the values for a temperature.

276
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:53.850
P2: On all my months from my months so that makes some sense, and so I suppose I don't really and I don't know what the Group word means and all of this, but.

277
00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:01.080
P2: Okay, I feel like there's something that's going on down there and I can't get to it, for some reason at the bottom of the plot and.

278
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.560
P2: yeah I saw I don't know what this part here is doing.

279
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.130
P2: But that's okay don't have to and.

280
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:22.950
P2: A but this makes some sense to me I think i've interpreted correctly right, so the red one is the is essentially what I my means and the blue one is my is my Max is over that period of time, if I had.

281
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.030
P2: No, because I I don't know how I would have.

282
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:36.000
P2: I would have thought it might be an interesting to over that time period to plot say whether the temperature and PM 25 or.

283
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:41.220
P2: Something and something, but I don't know how I could have done that, given the way the groups were offered to me here.

284
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:52.290
P2: Because I was only allowed to pick one variable to compare groups, if I understood correctly, I could try, one more time, I suppose, and now you can only pick one variable like certain say which crazy want to group.

285
00:36:53.460 --> 00:37:05.010
P2: Six for each environment variable would different eat explore each environment variable with the different plots Okay, so I could have a look at a box talk now, but I think this is going to be much less interesting.

286
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.890
P2: Oh sorry because variable true let's stick with temper.

287
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.970
P2: Okay, so what the hell is this telling me and.

288
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.870
P2: The total set of Max temperatures.

289
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.690
P2: across my six months.

290
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.530
P2: looks like this, and this the box style, and this is the means.

291
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:51.510
P2: OK so again i'm able to compare my temperature maximum is my main jobs but I might be able to like be able to to see something to work and take two variables and see if there's a correlation or something going on between the two of them.

292
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.680
P2: Okay, I think i've done work supposed to do here as best I can do and go back and look at the task.

293
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:12.060
P2: Okay, so I did my best on that okay now she's one of the queries to export you can go to that tab click the export bond ratios diligence to find opens up.

294
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:24.570
P2: And trying on the left hand side panel and click on the download zip with all data tables to download all the all the greats mission session as as it for you, be done went understanding, where the stage is stored okay.

295
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:36.060
P2: OK and limp okay over here and perhaps I wasn't paying enough attention because I can't go to go now we need to click.

296
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:41.520
P2: download.

297
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:55.890
P2: Okay, so this seems to be all queries I thought you'd mentioned being able to do some queries and not algorithm just read this again.

298
00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:10.320
P2: and choose one of the quiz to export and go to the top okay click the export button OK, and then zip download Okay, so I didn't do that I went to the second task for us to go to the first chance for us to I can q1.

299
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:24.090
P2: q2 and so i've done q1 The only question now is whether this is the bottom that you want me to download is there.

300
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.950
P2: Is there any other workplace or concept know so it's going to do this.

301
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.570
P2: Okay.

302
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:48.990
P2: So you put in the local phone named up five I can't get a job thanks OK so i'm assuming that I would find that, if this is my computer that will work Okay, and I guess.

303
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.370
P2: I guess that i've done all the query so I have to go back here and see if I can work this out again.

304
00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:08.820
P2: So choose one of the queries to export you want to talk to, and then go to that tab click the export button okay I didn't find the export but that's where my problem is too large so pick one query.

305
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:33.420
P2: Contact tab open query open description, to the da okay that's all about what's going on.

306
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:42.570
P2: Data time series box toss polar plus or maybe the data tab that might be Part A higher so can we make sense.

307
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.360
MODERATOR: Because you were the loading into my computer I just press cancel.

308
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:49.620
MODERATOR: Okay.

309
00:40:50.940 --> 00:41:02.400
P2: OK so that's how I would export that data that makes sense and then this one exported all the data does okay so seven says my overall impressions and.

310
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:18.750
P2: Okay, and so my overall impressions is it's useful in terms of ways, looking at environmental variables and a possibly I misunderstood something about the grouping, so I wasn't able to do.

311
00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:27.060
P2: What would seem to me to be useful to compare one variable against another one across a time series, or maybe multiple variables across a time series.

312
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:40.860
P2: And, and that may be misunderstanding your mind and and I also as i've explained don't understand the how what relationship, there is between the.

313
00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:49.050
P2: vasculitis high probability of flare and the days that i'm looking at I basically as far as I can make out with looking at data.

314
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:54.390
P2: For all the dates in question now maybe if I picked a different county where there were fewer cases.

315
00:41:54.990 --> 00:42:05.580
P2: But I don't see how that's going to be different if I if I made the query I made I would expect to be getting weather variables and or pollution variables means or max's or whatever, I chose.

316
00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:17.520
P2: For all the days in that time period which is seems to be completely independent of whether somebody had a flare or not so that's I think I explained those to come come and complications.

317
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:30.600
P2: Throughout the interview so and he it was it was I was a what was able to do everything I was supposed to do, I can't help, I was able to do everything was supposed to do.

318
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:40.590
P2: And, but the things that I was able to do were reasonably easy to do some of the buttons took a little while to find that, because some are very small, given the way in which we were carrying out this.

319
00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:55.470
P2: exercise which wasn't ideal on my laptop screen and and, and so my yeah so my overall experience was a little bit frustrating, I suppose, because of the, as I say, the setup and the delays.

320
00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:09.990
P2: A and a little bit confusing because of the two things i'm confused, but I don't understand groups very well and I don't understand the relationship between the disease and the flares and whatever, so I think i've done as much as I can do by summarizing probably my experience.

321
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.440
yeah.

322
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.610
MODERATOR: and well, so the recording now.

323
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.390
Okay.
