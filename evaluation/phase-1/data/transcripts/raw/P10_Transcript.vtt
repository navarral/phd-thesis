5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.379
P10: The zoom is fine for me.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.350
P10: Okay, let me see now yeah to take.

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.200
yeah and then.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.580
P10: I.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:35.880
P10: might just minimize this yeah okay and i'm back so just let me check that I can still right so not yet that's grant yeah.

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.550
MODERATOR: Okay, so P10 i'm going to set a timer and whenever you want, you can start reading the first task.

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.080
Okay.

12
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:23.820
P10: Okay, see dashboard heist the complexities of 1989 across the desired outcome sport has great researchers identify appropriate environmental variables, to enable to hope exploration researching rare disease, how to use the dashboard select submit the query inputs on the left.

13
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:37.170
P10: explore the resulting link to environmental data that appear after clicking submit export the data for your needs a text file named user query history, our text is automatically saved on the APP locker folder.

14
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.650
P10: With history of your query and put selections you'll be able to use this files get the data directly to an API in the future.

15
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:58.290
P10: Environmentally it elsewhere, so we go from the following source web pollution aerosol data data point stands to click button and hover over agents to get the number of data points right, so this is my query window here.

16
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.750
P10: or sorry my patients already there we are and vasculitis so click on that.

17
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.710
MODERATOR: This one do you mind completing a task one first.

18
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.500
P10: task one and.

19
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.330
P10: Oh, and oh sorry apologies apologies I skipped a title is yet and.

20
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.460
P10: Now okay so i'm trying to figure out how to zoom in here.

21
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.420
P10: Maybe it's.

22
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.980
MODERATOR: These arrows at the bottom, or just for me some someone.

23
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.500
P10: Okay.

24
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.040
P10: Maybe I can still get.

25
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.480
here.

26
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.250
P10: Okay, so this is given me the number of.

27
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.090
P10: Data points Tennessee.

28
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.720
P10: Number of data points right so i'm figuring out here.

29
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.390
P10: Okay, so what i'm looking at here is this is effectively, the number of patients that are recorded in each.

30
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.340
county.

31
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.730
P10: Rights there's be tree and county awfully and there's pollution records for three patients.

32
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.660
P10: And so i'd expect see a much higher density if I move over to Dublin whoops frozen look at this.

33
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.500
P10: yeah.

34
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.980
P10: So yeah I see I see 27 here, though right so.

35
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.110
Oh.

36
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.110
P10: See 27 so fiduciary constraints several weather equals three data points density equals 30.

37
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:32.010
P10: Okay, so I just try and figure out what the data points density is here right so obviously it means records, but i'm.

38
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.210
P10: not entirely sure.

39
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:47.130
P10: i'm not entirely sure what it means, and so i'm just going to say the multiple meanings that I think it could have it could be, it could be like you know.

40
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.000
P10: It could be like 27 different pollution locations and three weather locations for Dublin.

41
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:07.950
P10: Because we Turkey days point sensitive tarty it could be related to patients could give me the number of patients that are recorded and, although that would seem a little bits that seem a little this.

42
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.620
P10: ambiguous, so if we go over here i'm just going to spend a little few more minutes trying to explore this.

43
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.590
P10: told you to be an outlier and so, for example.

44
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.020
P10: Come county monahan to pollution.

45
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.010
P10: records zero weather records.

46
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.650
P10: Oh.

47
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.840
P10: i'm good.

48
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.850
P10: Okay i'm not accept or not, I think about a bit ambiguous what the.

49
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.900
MODERATOR: What the actual data.

50
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.760
P10: Point stance to me, so I think an explanation of what what that.

51
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:55.140
P10: means there because it's CERT it's not clear enough here and okay so that's my task one.

52
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.970
MODERATOR: And you're Mr mystery to the first school soon.

53
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:16.350
P10: So i've clicked the open map to visualize and kind of an explorer data source spike to race clicking and popping up in a new tab.

54
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.840
P10: Okay hold on a second maybe if Mr up here.

55
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.620
P10: What says.

56
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.770
P10: Okay, so we're looking actually at the location of interest rates so.

57
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.230
P10: and

58
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.010
MODERATOR: So P10 I will ask you one more time and if my book and move on, if you would like to read this one again the first sentence.

59
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:38.850
P10: yeah read it, read the text within home tab and main panel, the land explored as a source of your choosing by right clicking and opening in a new tab.

60
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.790
P10: or apologies yeah.

61
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.940
P10: I mean you mean you mean this here yeah.

62
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.830
P10: Okay.

63
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.270
P10: Nice.

64
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.220
P10: location access and.

65
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.510
MODERATOR: This is.

66
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:11.160
P10: Bringing me to the mess Aaron okay sighs yeah and then autocad daily data.

67
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.010
MODERATOR: here just acknowledging where the data comes from should be enough to complete this.

68
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.350
P10: Okay yeah okay.

69
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.420
P10: So.

70
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.820
P10: oops.

71
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.600
P10: yeah.

72
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.810
P10: Okay, so that's so that's that on yeah.

73
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.890
yeah.

74
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.700
P10: Okay, and.

75
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.750
P10: All right now, so, so the task to and.

76
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.080
P10: For us to submit a query using the input options available and query tab.

77
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:56.310
P10: Sorry, no emotion view here right, so the input OPS faded in the query tab on the left, most pan.

78
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:04.020
P10: Why you're selecting the query options, please explain it out the specific choices that you make closer to the half of first.

79
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:17.700
P10: So the first option, obviously we have a classical license in Ireland that might be extended at some point something else, and then we want to look at the event of interest so i've got a PIC high probability and got to cancel and all their.

80
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.240
P10: Non and and.

81
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:34.110
P10: As you as you make choices, you want to become available for you to select once you reach the end, please click the submit button once which will all be available valid inputs have been selected.

82
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.920
P10: Okay, so these are the.

83
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:50.070
P10: These are obviously all of the eli the event of interest date here assist gives me a like a little kind of snapshot of what it is.

84
00:09:50.640 --> 00:10:04.560
P10: And what I want to do, then, is, I want to mind down and take the location of interest down here, so if I went for something like longford I think just one patient and long for different correct maybe two.

85
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.150
P10: And to have to click Ireland well, maybe, maybe, for the moment, so it's got to be.

86
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.170
MODERATOR: were delayed me to explain why what do you think this Ireland modern means.

87
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:24.150
P10: And so I think, maybe it's, too, is it to do with the and the.

88
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.840
P10: And the kinds of the pan European Network for vasculitis that.

89
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.790
MODERATOR: If somebody was you can also say it's it's fine Thank you.

90
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.350
and

91
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.200
P10: yeah it's it's worth.

92
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.790
P10: Trying to.

93
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:48.150
P10: Trying to yeah i'm just trying to maybe guess what it is sorry i'm very.

94
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:56.040
MODERATOR: I would advise not selecting a word, by not selecting it if you're not comfortable learning what it means for the future of the query.

95
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.620
P10: Okay, and.

96
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.150
P10: What I mean so.

97
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:25.470
P10: i'm selecting the location of interest, which is long first race, so that I would, so this is an Ireland thing right, so I would work there's just Ireland at the moment, maybe this is for something in the future boss, and with langford oh just assume that that's at a county.

98
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.200
P10: county level for lanford and that's what it does.

99
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.160
MODERATOR: Take effort.

100
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:37.500
P10: And now to start date when I want, I want to take all dates for all data longford and so.

101
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:38.910
P10: well.

102
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.640
P10: See.

103
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.110
P10: Think i've frozen again here.

104
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.110
P10: Well, there we are right so take the first of August.

105
00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.980
P10: 2022.

106
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:04.980
P10: Sorry for the bad.

107
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.520
P10: is happening is it's bouncing I don't know if you can see that on that side but.

108
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.070
P10: it's bouncing back off here.

109
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.820
P10: And that's just as zoom thing.

110
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:24.630
P10: hey.

111
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:30.990
P10: This isn't.

112
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.630
MODERATOR: I can do it for you.

113
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.290
MODERATOR: This has.

114
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.280
P10: taken up yeah it's just not it doesn't seem to be yet okay.

115
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:50.400
P10: So I will just do something simple so i'll take until the seventh of November, and what I will do is i'll take I just took a pollution.

116
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:59.340
P10: And my time granularity but i'm going to aren't I think i'd be okay with daily.

117
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:07.530
P10: And then we can select the mean the men or the Max so i'm going to select.

118
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.900
P10: The Max there.

119
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.730
P10: and

120
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:21.420
P10: Let me see what happens Okay, this is my cue one that's that's.

121
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:31.230
P10: A period and what i'm seeing here now is a okay what i'm on to task three, I think.

122
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:37.440
P10: yeah right so explored Q on tab in order to understand the table underneath there are two buttons.

123
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.460
P10: That help you to interpret the data tip that you see.

124
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:57.570
P10: Okay, this is my open color table description yeah commenting allowed and their usefulness and clarity as explanations and then read the text of the day sub tab right so look up here first.

125
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.630
P10: Okay, so this is just giving me a summary.

126
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:22.050
P10: Of the data that i'm looking at us and time frequency sampling and the kind of the the aggregation method is a summary method.

127
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:23.460
MODERATOR: Would you say.

128
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.240
P10: If I.

129
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.190
MODERATOR: Would you say, is it useful for you.

130
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:41.490
P10: And yet, I think that is useful, yes it's like the Meta data so it's it's good to just check that you're looking at the at the right summary and then, if we look at the orange color table a.

131
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:51.480
P10: quarter table description apologies, maybe as fast I have pressed already.

132
00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:20.010
P10: Okay, so i'm just seeing here and a description of a table that I haven't actually seen yes.

133
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:28.080
P10: Okay, which, I might see in a moment, but I remember, I remember that saying there and now okay so.

134
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.370
P10: then read the text in the days of Sub tab.

135
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:43.440
P10: and talk to the interpretation of the variables and sell background colors red and blue after data table, you can select columns that you want to split a tub columns Part One

136
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:50.220
P10: Note that you could scroll vertically and horizontally and use the page errol's to check around today said that she's right.

137
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:58.800
P10: So and full name of the variables view disappear when hovering over the headings today's table for further information, please refer to the data sources links.

138
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:08.970
P10: The top of columns button allows to select kinds of interest and export button to download the data as a csv file right so we're looking here, as we have.

139
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:16.770
P10: An Okay, so this is for the patient or patients that are in longford and.

140
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.740
P10: We are looking at 2pm 2.5.

141
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.100
P10: Okay, and.

142
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.100
P10: Now I would there.

143
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:38.340
P10: i'm looking at the units there and i'm seeing yuji police are cute probably meant to be micrograms.

144
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.440
P10: So I would, I would say, there needs to be an ascii.

145
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:59.520
P10: and asked a key from you in the air, so where and or maybe I just think that it's maybe non standard and and now this looks this is nice here, so what i'm seeing so it's.

146
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.850
P10: Okay right, so I can see them or see them effectively.

147
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.820
P10: I think, by clicking the I, but how do I get back if I want to look at them again.

148
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.630
P10: I might I might see it, this rice other So if I click that I.

149
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.700
MODERATOR: Do you want to read the text on top of the table again.

150
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.280
Okay yeah.

151
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.890
MODERATOR: Would you like to explore the toggle button, as it says in the second paragraph.

152
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.240
yeah.

153
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.510
Okay.

154
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:16.230
P10: Right so i'm seeing PM 2.5 here now, I want to us think about this higher high and low values.

155
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.350
P10: So am I, seeing that.

156
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.700
P10: Am I seeing the color table here.

157
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:25.800
P10: or not.

158
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.750
P10: i'm not sure whether it's.

159
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.250
P10: Whether it's just what i'm seeing it.

160
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.670
MODERATOR: it's fine.

161
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:50.670
P10: So i'm not sure if I see the but obviously this isn't the color table, but how could I see the color table.

162
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.910
P10: Okay, but we may.

163
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.470
P10: Come back and gotta go back to that asks yeah i've got to go back to the task, because i'm a figure.

164
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.180
P10: It out okay.

165
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.260
P10: And it's text to the day sub tab.

166
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:12.900
P10: Get.

167
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:17.730
P10: Okay.

168
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.670
MODERATOR: If you want your pen moving to the next task it's fine.

169
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:40.590
P10: yeah okay i'll go go into the next task right so and explore the other types, besides the data tab all three plots ties here is butts porter porter plus our interactive features for different purposes.

170
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.550
P10: Please use those features for each part by mentioned you use a spoon and understanding environmental data.

171
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:56.010
P10: you'll be done when you have explored through the interactive features for each of the three plus tabs okay.

172
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.670
P10: Okay.

173
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:11.820
P10: Right, so this obviously has something to do with my toggle and here.

174
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:18.840
P10: I can, I can actually decide which of them, I want to look at it's going to replay this in PM 10 for me.

175
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.380
P10: enough.

176
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:41.910
P10: Let me scroll down this.

177
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.770
P10: backslash maybe I misunderstood something here and.

178
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.710
P10: Okay, maybe there's no data.

179
00:20:50.250 --> 00:21:04.950
P10: For us, yes that's what it is course okay so it's all of the stage was populated ABC and six six series here yeah okay and writer zoom hover.

180
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.110
P10: Okay that's quite nice actually.

181
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:29.370
P10: And theories set of range slider kick a drag set period of interest okay yeah that's really nice that rage slider there okay so look the box plots.

182
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.400
P10: and

183
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.630
P10: All.

184
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.330
P10: The time series.

185
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:55.020
P10: just go back to the time series just for a second, so I suppose I was looking at this, with regard to.

186
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.790
P10: With regard to the fence.

187
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.290
P10: apologies.

188
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.340
P10: i'm not touch my mouse here and.

189
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.050
P10: I think it's actually just it's just got the life of.

190
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.160
P10: rice just gonna let me, let me.

191
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:29.850
P10: Oh sorry yeah okay now and right so i'm looking at this and i've clicked a high high probability.

192
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:46.320
P10: high poverty event for lung for it's like a PM 2.5 so i'm assuming there's that there's obviously no events during this time period in line for it right because events would be highlighted, with.

193
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.200
P10: With some kind of marker.

194
00:22:50.970 --> 00:23:00.660
P10: So i'm just wondering now it's a shame, I didn't pick Dublin because I could have a look at that, but anyway race i'm going to move on going to close the box plus.

195
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:14.250
P10: The box Plaza is a little bit less clear to me how would use us from an interpretation point of view, because the data is inherently time orders, so the box plot kind of.

196
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:22.620
P10: It breaks the ordering there, which is guess the time ordering is the is this important part for and.

197
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:34.140
P10: Think about this data, but useful nonetheless see the distribution of values and an extreme supports and.

198
00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.050
P10: We just looked the interactive features here for these.

199
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.020
P10: Okay.

200
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.390
P10: Okay i'm not sure.

201
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.760
P10: i'm not sure if this is useful if this is nice to hear that.

202
00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:06.480
P10: But this is soo this to impart that that's a maturity utility that is and Okay, but we can can actually so tell me zoo.

203
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.060
P10: matter anyway Okay, no, we don't wants to dash.

204
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:20.040
P10: Now gotta move supporter plus it's got to be the last one and.

205
00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:33.600
P10: Now, I chose some pollution so i'm not sure if this will give me anything but it mice and.

206
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:48.750
P10: Okay, now I need to think about this right, so that the port of our seats for wind for wind speeds.

207
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.510
P10: and

208
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.750
P10: I think there's only relevant for the weather, for the weather.

209
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.870
P10: connections yeah so even though.

210
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:10.530
P10: they're not things like PM 2.5 and I think that there's an interaction, maybe between the wind and under PM 2.5 push and.

211
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.540
P10: But I think.

212
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.000
P10: i'm wondering.

213
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.530
P10: Should this option be here if i'm selecting.

214
00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.800
P10: Okay, if i'm selecting just pollution.

215
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.760
P10: So i'm just wondering if it's if it's ambiguous.

216
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.410
P10: Okay, and.

217
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.280
P10: Okay, and task five then i'm finished task for.

218
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:50.400
P10: have completed everything that's in there and right so i've been asked clear to your queries after you've submitted down following the same instructions in step two you'll see q2 q3 is new task main panel Now you can compare it with comparative tab.

219
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.600
P10: read the text this tab and select number of groups, you wish to make.

220
00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:09.750
P10: And click on click to generate groups and you input group appear underneath arranger queries into groups and click on public right is a lot of stuff in there right, so what i'm going to do is go to first of all, what I was talking about actually looking at.

221
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:17.460
P10: Looking at the high publishers you've got to look at his job and now because langford obviously has very few.

222
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.400
P10: And so I can also so I can don't Dublin into this as well, and what that will do is.

223
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.300
MODERATOR: It will.

224
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.950
P10: It will open up the.

225
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.280
P10: floor open up Q to tab now I might need your help on.

226
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:40.950
P10: The dates, here again, and I can I can, is there any way that I can select the same dates for.

227
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.610
P10: It the same dates for long to Dublin.

228
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.590
P10: Or do I do I re select I re select them I just re select them again yeah.

229
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.370
Okay.

230
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:15.630
P10: yeah that makes sense because they have to be of the same of the same time scale, if I am doing a comparison of.

231
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.770
P10: All rice and.

232
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:35.970
P10: Now, and i'll do another one as well polities, and so I will also look at high probability in.

233
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.830
P10: c or there other hotspots or Wexford.

234
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.430
P10: should remember this.

235
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.110
P10: i'm added to my time here.

236
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.140
P10: it's not going to be a purse or best today.

237
00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.760
MODERATOR: And if i'm P10.

238
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.620
P10: let's see.

239
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.950
P10: I might need your help here again.

240
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.360
P10: This one just has caused others through the zoom for some reason.

241
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:09.660
MODERATOR: Yet.

242
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.560
that's perfect.

243
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.110
P10: A.

244
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:23.760
P10: I can actually just type in today either take a take that one.

245
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.220
and

246
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.380
submit.

247
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.000
P10: Okay, so I should have three tabs up here now.

248
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.570
P10: query to query three.

249
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.860
P10: birds okay and.

250
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.240
P10: Have a look at the comparison tab.

251
00:28:50.190 --> 00:29:00.870
P10: Okay query days previous submission of the session compared by specific variable you can combine these queries into groups, the multiple selection inputs testing increase signal to noise ratio.

252
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:28.440
P10: And sort of side, the number of groups that you wish to compare select which queries you want to group explorer which invite each environment very the different groups queries are grouped by using the mean per unit of time and the time series plus.

253
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:35.130
P10: By concatenation the values in the box a dist what's.

254
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:43.230
P10: There, for the time series plus has a limitation and comparing queries with different time units.

255
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.830
P10: it's it's not having a problem with the with the task here i'm just trying.

256
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.340
P10: To get my head around the statistical reasoning here.

257
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.680
P10: Okay, so.

258
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:14.340
P10: query jays previous mission method can be compared by specific variable right so take PM 2.5 you can combine these queries into groups with them with the multiple selection inputs.

259
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:21.090
P10: To potentially increase the signal to noise ratio.

260
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:23.430
i'm.

261
00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:33.180
P10: What i'm saying is that signal signal to noise ratio here so really What it means is the coefficient of variation.

262
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:34.620
MODERATOR: right because we're.

263
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:47.490
P10: we're talking here about none so we don't have any model, as such, my internet's a bit though there so sorry for that no okay well look look we'll just we'll.

264
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.230
P10: Okay, so if I want.

265
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.900
P10: To acute tree.

266
00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.270
P10: Okay it's kicking to generate groups and.

267
00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:57.750
MODERATOR: Have you.

268
00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.600
P10: Okay, so let's go again here so cue to.

269
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.320
P10: q3.

270
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.310
P10: And then click to plush rice so.

271
00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.030
MODERATOR: Okay.

272
00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:34.110
P10: I saw trying to figure out what the meeting is that did I use click to generate groups button.

273
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:36.660
MODERATOR: Yes.

274
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:37.650
I did.

275
00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:53.310
P10: yeah okay sorry that's my fault right and now okay so who wants to up the variables so i'm going to look at something like and.

276
00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.840
P10: Well, I think that's a click pollution.

277
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:03.660
P10: yeah So these are i've seen some weather very was here and that's confused me it's.

278
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.340
a mess of pick both.

279
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.010
P10: So.

280
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.660
P10: I would expect to see PM 2.5 is higher in.

281
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.060
P10: In.

282
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:24.750
P10: Total talking now 10 quality very helpful here would be when i'm looking over at the legend.

283
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.750
P10: Rather than group one.

284
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.100
P10: I had a label that was attached to the location.

285
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.480
Okay.

286
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:43.200
P10: Or the the the Ad a lie, so another ad or a label, rather than the group one because it's and.

287
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:56.790
P10: And I think yeah so so the reason i'm saying that is because, if I look here to see group 1pm 2.5 group 2pm 2.5 then look up here and these I see q2 q3.

288
00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.340
P10: For me, so I think that the labels look.

289
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.870
P10: Slightly slightly ambiguous.

290
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.310
Okay.

291
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:25.890
P10: And I think will be clear with it at a lot but but anyway getting back so i'm trying to remember now, and although I can go up and click I can go back up and click into my queue to see which of those otherwise it was.

292
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.600
P10: county.

293
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.530
yep.

294
00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:31.740
P10: and

295
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:37.080
P10: So where does it tell me do I hear.

296
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.560
P10: Maybe maybe it tells me on this.

297
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.460
oops.

298
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.440
P10: static, where I get that information.

299
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.240
MODERATOR: That you visited before, if you remember.

300
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.470
MODERATOR: If not it's fine you can continue.

301
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:10.650
P10: yeah I think I think I was just continue rope because I can't I can't call now anyway okay so.

302
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.030
P10: So this group one corresponds to Q to.

303
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.210
P10: Which is.

304
00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:19.770
P10: Dublin.

305
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:32.430
P10: yeah on group to corresponds to q3 which is Wexford gosh.

306
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.220
P10: and

307
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:45.060
P10: So if I look yeah I do I do find us a little bit that does require the work ethic.

308
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.690
MODERATOR: To.

309
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.030
P10: Twitter, which is which I do, I do think so.

310
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:56.910
P10: But it's not it's not a it's not a it's not a debate it's just for for us to convenience, but now, so what I would be expecting here is that.

311
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.550
P10: yeah I would sort of expect Wexford, to have the lower.

312
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:18.180
P10: tier 2.5 overtime, but we're looking at Max PM 2.5 here, but maybe we don't want to get into the analysis and that kind of thing so i'm gonna go to the next task if i've completed everything and this this one, and so no I don't think I have.

313
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:29.520
P10: So we have three different visualizations right, so we have the time series which compares to to overlays to to have a look at the box plus.

314
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:36.930
Okay.

315
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.450
P10: and

316
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.330
P10: So it doesn't cash the PM 2.5 so I need to.

317
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:47.790
P10: need to go.

318
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:13.380
P10: Okay, this looks these look very squashed and they look roughly on the same scale and.

319
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.860
P10: I would find difficult because the.

320
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:24.060
P10: Because so so obviously the scale of the y axis is up a lot, because of the of the outliers.

321
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.570
MODERATOR: You know.

322
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:43.140
P10: And I would think like sometimes people would use log 10 transformations to plan to make the scales comparable, but maybe not in this case, because actually the extreme values, there may be something that we're interested in and and.

323
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.320
P10: And then we look after this.

324
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.700
P10: Okay.

325
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.280
P10: So this is and.

326
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:23.850
P10: I need to figure out what this is maybe there's an explanation separate but looks like some distance between distributions like a.

327
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:34.410
P10: clawback lie blur or some kind of histogram distance and so.

328
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.350
P10: yeah and.

329
00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:45.630
P10: it's this the distance over time, or is the distance or distribute so let me see where's the.

330
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:56.790
P10: So the scale here on the y X the X axis not labels.

331
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:07.050
P10: Okay, so I think actually it's not tests distribution is distribution right so it's an empirical distribution so it's currently density estimate here.

332
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.070
MODERATOR: What does.

333
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:13.020
P10: that's what we're seeking we can compare we can compare the two and.

334
00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:20.310
P10: And maybe a better maybe a better Labor for that.

335
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:24.060
P10: yeah maybe basher yeah and.

336
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:35.640
P10: produce yes for sure okay so let's let's clear enough OK, and now, so I think i've completed a task five.

337
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:43.170
P10: yep and now going on to task six centuries to export q1 q2 q3 gold star tab.

338
00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:57.300
P10: click the export from the data table to download the data a csv file finally open sit down tab on the left side panel and click on downloads it with all data tables.

339
00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.970
P10: Okay, so I want to download.

340
00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.340
P10: Dublin.

341
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:15.360
Okay.

342
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.880
P10: And then I want to click export.

343
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.670
MODERATOR: and want to cancel the export to my computer.

344
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.620
P10: Okay well.

345
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.340
P10: that's that's fine yeah and then I got to sit down Lord.

346
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:29.760
yep.

347
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:36.390
P10: And download zip with all data tables Do I need to click this and you can cancel.

348
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.500
MODERATOR: This you want to look good.

349
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:38.670
yeah.

350
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.110
P10: Okay.

351
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.920
P10: anything happening there.

352
00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.120
MODERATOR: it's fine.

353
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.070
P10: Okay, great.

354
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.320
P10: and

355
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:05.610
P10: So where's The stakes are stored what I guess see just to save, save the tour ever on your on your desktop.

356
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.680
P10: and

357
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:20.820
P10: Okay, so yeah I mean just so task seven then just summarizing the so rice and my experience.

358
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:26.520
P10: That was it was nice to us, I think feeling so needs to be.

359
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:43.320
P10: Maybe a little bit more user friendly product and it's very useful to navigate and I liked the time series it's a really good comparison I wouldn't be so convinced about the box.

360
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.170
P10: And I think.

361
00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:58.380
P10: I think, as well, and so the script how the.

362
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.490
P10: How the grouping certain rights today, the thing about.

363
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.250
P10: Increasing the signal to noise ratio.

364
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:10.410
MODERATOR: yeah.

365
00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.010
P10: yeah i'm not i'm not i'm not.

366
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:22.050
P10: convinced by that I think I know, right here you're putting all the data together you use it to get approved standard deviation.

367
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:33.000
P10: And they use an approved standard deviation to flag outliers are not put yeah it's maybe it's clear, for me, because I kind of maybe have worked with that kind of thing before.

368
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.260
and

369
00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.480
MODERATOR: welcomes.

370
00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:39.390
P10: You yeah and.

371
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:48.270
P10: Yes, so I think I think it's it's very useful very useful interface overall and I to comparative.

372
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:54.450
P10: side, what I would like is that if the events for overlay and the dates of the events, because then.

373
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:54.540
MODERATOR: You.

374
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:59.220
P10: can compare it with the time series that's where I think that would be most useful.

375
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.410
P10: and

376
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.090
P10: chat.

377
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:04.890
Think.

378
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.930
P10: yeah I don't have any other feedback at a most the feedback, maybe during the.

379
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:11.940
MODERATOR: Government so.

380
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:13.560
P10: yeah.

381
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:21.000
P10: perfect and Okay, are there so is there a survey you want me to complete now as well, I think.

382
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.320
MODERATOR: Yes, so i'm gonna stop sharing so zoom get faster.

383
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.240
MODERATOR: and want to send the.

384
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:35.700
MODERATOR: questionnaire and I wanted to say that you were like more or less similar to the other participants in terms of time.

385
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.510
P10: So that's Okay, and also the feedback that you provided it's.

386
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:47.250
MODERATOR: More or less on the line of the others, so what i'm what are you doing the following well i'm not gonna say just do so you can complete the questionnaire.

387
00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.050
MODERATOR: and

388
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.840
P10: Can I do this, can I do that offline.

389
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.220
MODERATOR: yeah yeah absolutely.

390
00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.390
P10: yeah yeah okay.

391
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:03.360
P10: Okay, did you get this noise at.

392
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.320
It.
