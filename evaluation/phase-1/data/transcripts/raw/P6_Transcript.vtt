P6: ratio you decide the number of groups.

287
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:35.430
P6: That you wish to compare select which queries you want to group.

288
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:48.510
P6: and explore hmm and survivors with different words queries are computing the may appear unit of time in The Times there's blood and by can.

297
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.610
P6: Well time series box and.

298
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:21.570
