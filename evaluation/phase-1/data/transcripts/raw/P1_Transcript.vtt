12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.870
MODERATOR: If you can go one by one, and then do the tasks and i'm going to be timing these tasks.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.920
Okay.

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.080

MODERATOR: Yes, please.

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:00.540
P1: read the text within the home tab in the main panel allowed explore data source of your choosing by right clicking and opening in a new tab.

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.910
P1: Once you feel you understand where the data comes from click the button open.

18
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.310
P1: To visualize the density of data points medications of interest to be done when you mentioned a few the analyze that data points available.

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.640
P1: Okay, so.

20
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.360
P1: You don't have control anymore.

21
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.140
P1: it's very slow.

22
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.400
P1: High and escape dashboard dashboard hides the complexities and linkedin.

23
00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.110
P1: Clinical rare disease data with environment observations using knowledge, crafts, the desired outcome is to support health data researchers identify appropriate.

24
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.570
P1: Environmental variables, to enable your hypothesis exploration in research and rare disease.

25
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:21.930
P1: and select and submit the query inputs on the Left explore the resulting linked environmental data that appear after clicking submit export the data for your needs.

26
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.870
P1: A text file named user query history is automatically saved local folder.

27
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.610
P1: With the history of a query input selections will be able to use this file to get the data directly through an API and future.

28
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.500
P1: Data or environmental observations gathered from the following sources, whether pollution and aerosol data.

29
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.790
P1: Data points density click the point and hover over to get the data points okay so.

30
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.200
P1: Open map.

31
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.120
P1: I can see here that.

32
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.210
P1: Pollution in Dublin to 27 data points three whether.

33
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.180
P1: it's data points sensitive 30.

34
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.480
P1: Cork, the data point St 11.

35
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.870
P1: Always data point that says three.

36
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.130
P1: query using the input options available in the query tab on the left, most panel.

37
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.560
P1: or a slice the query options, please explain the last two choices, you make, as you make choices new ones will become available for you to select.

38
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.330

P1: Okay, you will be done when a new tab name q1 is displayed in the main panel.

40
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.770
P1: Okay, so.

41
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.800
P1: Sorry i'm sorry rare disease.

42
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.250
P1: is quite a lag here I just know from your timing through the zoom.

43
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.710
P1: event of interest.

44
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.490
you've got a nice little.

45
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.030
P1: pop up there doesn't disappear, though.

46
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.250
P1: Unless you click it again okay.

47
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.480
P1: Definitely.

48
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.750
P1: Possible there should be an all there, I think.

49
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.100
P1: that combines definitely high probability can possible.

50
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.930
P1: and

51
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.370
P1: So try to take high probable where you can click multiple okay good.

52
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.850
P1: That allows you to combine okay that's good.

53
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.850
P1: So the dates.

54
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.120
P1: it's showing me Li Carlo Kevin identical.

55
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.220
P1: These are the event dates, where there has been flares.

56
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.210
P1: And I presume there's there's only three shown here and put to seven pages.

57
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.350
P1: So dub and obviously has a lot more.

58
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.570
P1: Okay, so this is just summarizing all the dates, where there has been flares.

59
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.760
P1: And our location of interests say Dublin.

60
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.370
P1: And you can select more than one.

61
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.950
P1: Day range so it's not clear that this is a.

62
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.430
P1: date field, I just clicked on that I just found that there was one there and.

63
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.930
P1: i'm just kind of struggling to get down there.

64
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.200
MODERATOR: yeah I think it was a bit of luck.

65
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.190
P1: and also the.

66
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.620
P1: I can't see the.

67
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.210
P1: calendar and.

68
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.860
MODERATOR: You can you.

69
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.360
MODERATOR: can use does the scrolling work for you yeah well, you have to click here sorry.

70
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.210
P1: yeah it's difficult because I.

71
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.280
P1: mean i'll try and pick something else.

72
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.490
P1: kind of write it in.

73
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.550
P1: And there's a lot there's a big lag actually so it's.

74
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.910
P1: very hard to reason it's very light Gray and.

75
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.980
P1: 2018.

76
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.260
P1: Oh wait.

77
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.450
P1: Okay, so I think it down there now.

78
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.390
P1: Though having to click.

79
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.690
P1: Through the months is not ideal, you should be able to click it to the years back, I think.

80
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.280
P1: The data sources temporary and it's.

81
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.530
MODERATOR: for the experiment only data from 2020 is available.

82
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:21.630
MODERATOR: Okay, because I accounted for the like in this room and then my using my computer and everything.

83
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.290
P1: data sources, whether.

84
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.260
P1: pick one of those can your.

85
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.940
P1: brother or pollution or both.

86
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.420
P1: And let's just go through whether.

87
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.190
P1: Anyone really dating month here in a very temporary units.

88
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.540
P1: don't think you'd ever need directly or even a.

89
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.130
P1: spatial temporal aggregation made Min Max.

90
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.510
P1: And you can only select one of those okay.

91
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:32.580
P1: So I don't exactly scenario where you only need man for Max you would need main median or Min Max both together.

92
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.420
P1: And let's go for this domain.

93
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.510
P1: Now this is presumably accessing some kind of triple store.

94
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.100
P1: So I completed the task down with I.

95
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.510
yeah.

96
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.490
P1: I just explore this anyway, so you can.

97
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.550
P1: query and put some description keisha.

98
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.020
MODERATOR: You want to read the next task.

99
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.050
P1: Okay.

100
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.340
P1: tables Nice, there are two buttons that hope you interpret the data that you see.

101
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.580
P1: click those buttons on top opening quick query input some rain open.

102
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.830
P1: table description.

103
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.100
P1: hey so i'm clicking on open query and put summary.

104
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.140
P1: will create and put summary, this gives you options rare disease.

105
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.110
P1: event of interest location of interest on the data.

106
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.870
P1: So this is.

107
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.690
P1: Over two pages i'm not sure whether that could appear on one, but you need to have to.

108
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.560
P1: So this just summarizes what we've put in.

109
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.540
P1: And clicking on the open table description.

110
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.850
P1: So the data data table data table background, so I think that should be two words.

111
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:45.120
P1: If data is normally distributed 90% 5% should be between minus two plus two is that scores and they're quite.

112
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.040
P1: It doesn't just say what if if the data is not normally distributed what happens like that would be useful to know.

113
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:59.640
P1: and values are grazing to our high value customize to I know Okay, so your.

114
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.330
P1: Simple score for that.

115
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.290
P1: Okay, then read the text in the data sub tab.

116
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.170
P1: and talk through the interpretation of variables are self evident colors.

117
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:38.610
P1: Okay.

118
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.550
P1: Excellent data sub tab.

119
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.580
P1: The variables, the units appear when hovering over the headings detached table.

120
00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:02.760
P1: for further information first data sources in the home tab okay toggle columns highlights select an extract.

121
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.050
P1: And extract button, I think you mean export button.

122
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:12.990
P1: and

123
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.460
P1: Okay, so.

124
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:49.500
P1: You can scroll vertically and horizontally and use a page arrows to check the meditation that you're querying i'm not sure if my pager I was what helped me here.

125
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.920
MODERATOR: No that's that's that's for me to control some stuff.

126
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.650
P1: and

127
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.780
P1: i'll try using my.

128
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.980
P1: Stop stop there.

129
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.150
MODERATOR: there's there's no more.

130
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:07.590
Okay.

131
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.400
P1: So we've got.

132
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.560
P1: Basically, seven months here as a whole dataset.

133
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.090
P1: and

134
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.880
P1: I guess it's not clarify that that score applies to just this data or the whole dataset.

135
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.070
P1: So you've got an average temperature.

136
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:47.340
P1: wet bulb you know, does he say pressure means he'll have a pressure wind speed.

137
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:52.950
P1: Okay.

138
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.260
P1: So I think i've done number three.

139
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.420
P1: Although we don't see any red or blue.

140
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.510
P1: fields.

141
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.280
P1: yeah so there's no right or two fields there, so I presume.

142
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:28.620
P1: That these values within this very restricted data sets are within the 75 or 95% confidence intervals.

143
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.770
P1: Okay, so what's not clear to me, is exactly what we're looking at here.

144
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.190
P1: So this is only referring to.

145
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.960
P1: don't see how it relates to the patients.

146
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.340
P1: So we have it looks like about 40 events.

147
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:13.170
P1: In Dublin, with the dates now, the issue here is that there were no dates within 2020.

148
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:17.640
P1: So.

149
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.000
P1: I don't understand how this relates to patients I think what you're showing me here is.

150
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.390
P1: Basically, a summary for.

151
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.430
P1: For 2020.

152
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.880
P1: But it doesn't have any relationship to the patient.

153
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.460
P1: Because, Sir, there are no patients with that, during that time period, so I think for running to the thing you might.

154
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.900
P1: expand your time period, so you definitely are events within that period.

155
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.620
MODERATOR: task for.

156
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:12.660
P1: The other tabs beside the data tab or three plots time series box plot plot are attractive features just purchase a piece those features for.

157
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.230
P1: Each mentioning usefulness.

158
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.170
P1: OK, we have our time series.

159
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.590
P1: lot of variables on this and they're a little the same they're just plotted against said score okay.

160
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.790
yeah.

161
00:17:53.040 --> 00:18:00.180
P1: there's a bit of a lag here so that's probably why it's difficult so so this thing at the bottom here is the full intro.

162
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.040
P1: And you can.

163
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.260
P1: click on this to zoom in and using the upper one that's what i'm seeing this is happening.

164
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.650
P1: Very cool.

165
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.610
P1: Thank you move your window back and forth.

166
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.930
P1: I can see here and they're kind of February first was a little bit outside their normal.

167
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.860
P1: Okay, so last time series very nice.

168
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.590
P1: X plus.

169
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.840
P1: shows, if you hover over, you can see, the actual values.

170
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.140
P1: And you have a portion here medium.

171
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.770
P1: So I assume the failure report medium that you have determined that the data is not only distributed.

172
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.860
P1: And if it was your report to me.

173
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.140
P1: that's a deviation.

174
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.140
P1: And so.

175
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.600
P1: So.

176
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:32.400
P1: Again, I think, for for ease you know these names of each along the X axis here.

177
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.140
P1: and

178
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:42.360
P1: The recipe, I mean I kind of know them, but it might be hard for a new person to understand what msl means, for example.

179
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.240
P1: So you might need something to where you can hover over that.

180
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.140
P1: To expand, or else have the the actual name of what it is.

181
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.220
P1: In there and in the X axis.

182
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:09.480
P1: Okay, so these are just bucks plus the other scenes there are little dots as well, I think these mushrooms, these represent as far as perhaps.

183
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.560
P1: A quick here what they mean.

184
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.740
P1: question comes up here mean.

185
00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.370
P1: Take a snapshot.

186
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.330
P1: that's not responding now.

187
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.130
P1: Chris I took a snapshot or last push.

188
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.490
P1: My okay so let's just save it.

189
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.990
MODERATOR: You can cancel those notes at my computer, please.

190
00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.050
P1: Okay it's disappeared on me now, so I don't see that box anymore.

191
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:34.620
Okay.

192
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.230
P1: You can cancel it if you want.

193
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:39.750
P1: Okay.

194
00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.060
P1: i'm excited to see what progress.

195
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.440
P1: I don't see okay so.

196
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.170
P1: So you can only select one variable for this.

197
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.010
P1: yeah that's not what this means that say.

198
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.800
MODERATOR: Would you mind reading the text.

199
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.020
P1: Complex variable when dependencies radius length indicates the wind speed.

200
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.280
P1: And the degrees of interaction visualization is interactive.

201
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.160
P1: sure what each of these points means so.

202
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.540
P1: Is it a day or.

203
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.220
P1: And why is rain clicked what is.

204
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.480
P1: The temperature, what does that too.

205
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.590
P1: So I mean the store down the bottom left so.

206
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.450
P1: When does down that direction and.

207
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.650
P1: capture 5.8 and the color Of these, which is a bit hard to see.

208
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:31.710
P1: The colors and.

209
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:40.050
P1: reflects the temperature on those days, so what you're seeing here is a combination of wind speed and direction plus temperature.

210
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:49.110
P1: I think that you know that this might be a bit too much for.

211
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:56.700
P1: me, certainly for this purpose bit too much to take in and for someone's brain.

212
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:04.260
P1: And, but it's a nice way of exploring wind direction which has always been a problem.

213
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.440
P1: Okay, so i've explored all three they're.

214
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:24.660
P1: Great tune your queries after you've submitted them follow following the same instructions in step two two new queries using step two.

215
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:37.020
P1: You will see q2 q3 as new tabs on the main panel Nathan compare them the proprietor tab read the text in this tab and select the number of groups who wish to make.

216
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:43.950
P1: Then click on click to generate groups I new inputs will per group will appear underneath.

217
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.430
P1: Right your queries in the group's click on click to plot groups.

218
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.240
P1: So the question you query.

219
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.460
P1: tricky.

220
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.500
P1: possible.

221
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:27.000
P1: So I mean one of the options here is no flare so i'm not quite sure what that means I guess it takes.

222
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.670
P1: All the encounters.

223
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.070
P1: Where flair is not mentioned.

224
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.790
P1: So this time we're going to look at.

225
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.800
P1: What this little button means.

226
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.620
P1: it's a Cork.

227
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:05.790
P1: K.

228
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.940
P1: date range for all perhaps here, this is an easy one.

229
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.440
P1: This time.

230
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.000
P1: can see, there are some right about now.

231
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.120
P1: PM 10pm 2.5 or 25 is not care.

232
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.350
P1: guess, we can have real rush to clarify okay it's clear.

233
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.360
P1: This is just one page.

234
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.250
P1: one page preach month.

235
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.400
P1: hey.

236
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.580
P1: Krishna query.

237
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.770
P1: The same inputs.

238
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.090
P1: Just like to look at.

239
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:31.200
P1: You know, two is important, you know collects to Disney.

240
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.890
P1: Simplified it now.

241
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.370
P1: See quite easily now.

242
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.810
P1: always just one month per page so just have that mixture here.

243
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.930
P1: And each line is a.

244
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.860
P1: red and blue, I think, maybe.

245
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.270
P1: You might have a quotation of red.

246
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.810
P1: Light red for just above 95%.

247
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.290
P1: Maybe 99% of a dark red or something like that cemetery on the blue.

248
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.760
P1: Okay, so i'm assuming here that each line represents one encounter.

249
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.270
P1: Maybe it's still not clear to me about that, but.

250
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.320
P1: Anyway, we're going to try and and comparison buddies now.

251
00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.390
P1: And the comparison tub.

252
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.420
P1: Time series for this.

253
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.130
MODERATOR: You if you want to read it again mark.

254
00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.550
P1: You two new tabs on the main hell yeah.

255
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.660
P1: Now you can compare them to the comparative top.

256
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.700
P1: Okay.

257
00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.120
P1: read the text in this tab and select groups, you wish to make.

258
00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.370
P1: Created previously submitted a session can be compared by specific variable.

259
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:44.970
P1: You can combine these queries into two into groups, the multiple selection inputs to potentially increase the exit signal to noise ratio.

260
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:51.360
P1: decide the number of groups that you wish to compare select which queries you want to group.

261
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.440
P1: explore environmental variables, the different plots.

262
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.990
P1: crazy grouped by computing the mean year per unit of time, the time series plotting the constant concatenate.

263
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.640
P1: The values in the box and distribution plots.

264
00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:14.430
P1: Therefore, the time series plot has a limitation of comparing queries with different timing it's.

265
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.440
P1: Okay.

266
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.290
P1: Can.

267
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:52.320
P1: generate groups, you had quotes per quick clip here underneath ranger queries groups and pick up groups.

268
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.790
P1: Combined to I guess one.

269
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.480
P1: Nice feature.

270
00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.330
P1: Time series bucks plush and distribution.

271
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.480
P1: Nothing there, yes.

272
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.780
P1: I have to select something here so unfair to compare the groups so i'd like to.

273
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.580
P1: So the problem here as such.

274
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.210
P1: We haven't.

275
00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:01.560
P1: Put comparing, whether in one position and another so cool about her.

276
00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.970
P1: Maybe i'll Just compare two and three.

277
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.580
P1: So this tells the number of groups.

278
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.710
P1: That have seen.

279
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:27.390
MODERATOR: You can't see because this room over there screaming sorry like I can try to fix it give me a second yeah.

280
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.220
P1: Okay, here we go.

281
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.370
P1: Okay, there you go to okay.

282
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.790
P1: let's try again just comparing the ones.

283
00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.670
P1: got this error message.

284
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.890
MODERATOR: me and we take it up and.

285
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.520
MODERATOR: I cannot, I cannot control the mouse.

286
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:10.980
P1: We take.

287
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.810
P1: So we have group one group too much outside.

288
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.270
P1: emissaries.

289
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.000
P1: I can only see the red one.

290
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.150
P1: I don't see it.

291
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.920
MODERATOR: Go to click the red one, please.

292
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:19.410
P1: Okay.

293
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.270
MODERATOR: They are actually the same quality, because you put it on the same let's let's move on as.

294
00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:32.340
P1: well.

295
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.170
P1: Too so it's the same area so same location.

296
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:41.970
P1: But.

297
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.050
P1: Because there are no events in 2020 is that right.

298
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.020
P1: and

299
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.720
P1: Aside from query to.

300
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.650
P1: Okay, so.

301
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.660
P1: Over time and again, we can.

302
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.470
P1: show a nice little.

303
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.110
P1: window.

304
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.240
P1: peek there.

305
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:51.990
P1: Okay.

306
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.490
P1: Okay, so you have the bucks Plus we have the individual values.

307
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.350
P1: are clearly not normally distributed.

308
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.980
P1: This value is.

309
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.460
P1: To mean I guess.

310
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.640
P1: yeah, so it is it's not clear which what these are what these dots represent you know so.

311
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:42.930
P1: This kind of linkage to the flare event, I think, might be at the root of some of this these problems.

312
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:44.940
P1: and

313
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.180
P1: Try distribution.

314
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.140
P1: that's not exactly what this means here.

315
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.950
P1: shows up here what's on the y axis here either.

316
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:31.140
P1: and

317
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.580
P1: I don't really understand this, plus.

318
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.690
P1: So presuming each one of these what's on the X axis is.

319
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.590
P1: days are not sure.

320
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.850
P1: So is present, maybe the X axis is the PM 2.5 valued.

321
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.430
P1: And this is the.

322
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.090
P1: distribution of values.

323
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.670
P1: and

324
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:15.540
P1: Okay, so you can see that this so it's basically a histogram.

325
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.570
P1: yeah you might kind of use the word histogram rather than just.

326
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.650
P1: that's clearly right skewed.

327
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.650
P1: Here as well, so that's Okay, so I need to.

328
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:39.930
P1: arrange your queries groups and click on the clock groups now he's appeared to be fraser's piece.

329
00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.870
P1: Okay, so I think I finished that one them.

330
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:54.390
P1: and choose one of the queries to export q1 q2 Austrian close that tab click the export button from the data table.

331
00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.570
P1: to download the data as a csv file finally open the zip downloads tab on the left side and.

332
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:07.920
P1: I don't know tip with all these tables to download all days for all the queries in session as a zip file.

333
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.590
P1: Okay.

334
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.080
MODERATOR: Please continue, please.

335
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.700
MODERATOR: If you can please can't even save it to my computer, please.

336
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.160
P1: Castle where.

337
00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.480
MODERATOR: What I bless it you can't you can go ahead, no.

338
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.390
P1: Okay, so you don't want to export.

339
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:43.560
No thanks.

340
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.120
P1: And the zip data tab left side panel.

341
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.300
P1: tables from this query Okay, I want to press.

342
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.690
MODERATOR: This one just to see what happens.

343
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.240
P1: files.

344
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.430
P1: This you have a choice should be cut to downloads.

345
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.130
P1: So.

346
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.670
P1: that's where we are.

347
00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:41.280
P1: summarize my experiences well it's really impressive means of.

348
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.160
P1: Exploring data.

349
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.180
P1: and

350
00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.090
P1: I think a little bit like last time.

351
00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.590
P1: it's not clear what the objectives are here i'm not sure.

352
00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.890
P1: You know the in terms of design of this for the users have been incorporated sufficient here in Austin and.

353
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.290
P1: It seems like.

354
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:08.940
P1: We are.

355
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:15.930
P1: Providing a value in the data table and in the in the graphs.

356
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.470
P1: For each encounter.

357
00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.990
P1: The best data from that encounter.

358
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:40.080
P1: I presume is the data from the county in which that encounter encounter occurred, rather than from the encounter itself.

359
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.480
P1: And it reflects the prevailing the prevailing.

360
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.690
P1: Whether or pollution values on that day.

361
00:42:53.340 --> 00:43:01.590
P1: or in that month, so if you want to link this to kind of a by a biological our experimental research question.

362
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.250
P1: As we've discussed many times in the adverb project.

363
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:07.500
P1: The.

364
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:17.220
P1: If we're looking at flare events, we need to understand the prevailing pollution weather data in a period before the slayer.

365
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:32.280
P1: So there's a pro travel period, you know it really doesn't matter what the the weather's like of the day, or even so many of the month, because the month presumably will be the calendar month.

366
00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.540
P1: And so the flare that may have happened, you know so sorry that happened at the end of the color calendar months, then.

367
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:47.940
P1: That might be helpful because it's the period, probably 123 or four weeks before the flare event.

368
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.400
P1: Or maybe even longer, because the patient doesn't always attend hospital immediately.

369
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.400
P1: that's The big challenge with all of this work is you know understanding that program will period.

370
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.020
P1: and

371
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:07.440
P1: So I think you probably need if you if you wanted, if this is going to be applied for this purpose and.

372
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.730
P1: They need something there that allows you to define a lag.

373
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.930
P1: You know the period where you can say well i'd like to see the data.

374
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:22.890
P1: You know one week two week three week or four weeks before the event or the encountering question.

375
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:25.860
P1: and

376
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.760
P1: And I think it's.

377
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:44.880
P1: yeah, so I think that, I mean the explorations really nice, yes, a few little bits where it's a bit tricky and there's a lag made it a bit more difficult as well, but you know it's very nicely laid out and.

378
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.170
P1: Your time series is really nice like that and.

379
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.710
P1: But when we're exploring this from a research point of view, where.

380
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:58.560
P1: we're almost certainly never going to look at an individual patients, you know it's.

381
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.270
P1: We need to have you know, large numbers of patients in each group.

382
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.590
P1: So I think reporting aggregate values is probably more important than exploring the individual patients but.

383
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:17.310
P1: But again, having access to the data table to show where the data is coming from, is also it's also useful and.

384
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:36.630
P1: yeah, so I think and it's it's quite intuitive in terms of running the test, I think I get people to read this the tasks before out so you got an idea took me a little while to.

385
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.900
P1: to work out what he wants me to do next.

386
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.880
P1: So, but yeah I mean it's a very famous very good to see us there and.

387
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.070
P1: see it in action, and I can certainly see this kind of approach.

388
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.500
P1: that's having a lot of applications beyond environment.

389
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.100
P1: The first one, I think, to think about is cider.

390
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.260
P1: You know the computerized infectious disease registry.

391
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.180
P1: That would be.

392
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.560
P1: Not too not too difficult, I mean basically it's the same thing in the sense that you have.

393
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:25.170
P1: For a given month, you have a number at a location and there might be a bit of good locations are not exactly matching your one so.

394
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.770
P1: and also the in terms of the environmental data.

395
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.720
P1: and

396
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.890
P1: You are deriving.

397
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:40.320
P1: From the actual weather stations, whereas I really think.

398
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.140
P1: You know I think you, you probably can't do that you know because.

399
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:53.310
P1: Inevitably we've had lots of meetings with chuck Gallagher about this is that, certainly with pollution.

400
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:54.780
P1: it's.

401
00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:02.370
P1: There are so few pollution stations that you cannot tell what the patient's be as close to by looking at a station.

402
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.220
P1: that have hit the measurements from that station and.

403
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:16.320
P1: You need some kind of land use regression or something else that interprets the value for.

404
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.960
P1: A given pollutant.

405
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:20.730
P1: and

406
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:31.140
P1: This generally means what these interpolation things do they take a lot of different data sources, they take the local measurement, but they also use satellite data.

407
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.760
P1: and

408
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.930
P1: You know, we have adopted this across of ours.

409
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.580
P1: Whereas you kind of seem to have gone a different way.

410
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:48.780
P1: And again, I think, early engagement with the wider team would it be important to identify that.

411
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.860
P1: So.

412
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:05.430
P1: yeah but I mean Actually, I mean the sources of data basically from Copernicus and.

413
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:17.280
P1: Global sources of data that's pretty easy to get access to that and use it as a data source, instead, perhaps you can think about man.

414
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:22.710
P1: yeah.

415
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.910
MODERATOR: Stop the recording.
