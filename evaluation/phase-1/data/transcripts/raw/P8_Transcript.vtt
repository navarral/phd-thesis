MODERATOR: perfect, so let us start okay.

3
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:38.100
P8: What you see on the screen or two panels with labels left panel and main panel read the text within the home tab in the main panel allowed and explore data source of your choosing by right clicking and opening and in a new tab once you feel you understand where the data come from.

4
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:53.220
P8: click a button open the map to visualize the density of the data points within the locations of interests, it was you'll be done when you mentioned a few of the locations of interest that have data points available.

5
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.960
P8: Okay, so home tab.

6
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.290
P8: Top seed semantic combining for exploring environment and disease data.

7
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.230
P8: i'm just going to read out loud everything I see, so I can just.

8
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.090
MODERATOR: mentally absorption.

9
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.950
P8: The seed dashboard hide the complexity linking clinical disease data with environmental observations using knowledge graphs.

10
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:36.480
P8: The desired outcome is to support health data researches identifies appropriate environment variables, to enable their policies exploration and research rare diseases, how to use the dashboard select the submit the query inputs on the Left kept.

11
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.900
P8: The queries listed here.

12
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.090
P8: explore the result, the resulting linkedin environmental data that appear after clicking submit export the data for your needs.

13
00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:08.010
P8: A text file named user query history to text is automatically saved in the APP local folder within with the history of your query input selections will be able to use the file to get the data directly through an API in the future.

14
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.450
P8: Data environment observations have been gathered from the following sources, whether pollution and our resource data right click plus open new tab.

15
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.230
P8: Data points density click the button.

16
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.410
P8: And hover over the region to get the number of data points so instruction was to read home tab.

17
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.510
P8: Okay.

18
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.070
P8: We did we read out loud choosing right click opening new device if you're in the Center of the day, to confirm click the button.

19
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.690
P8: Okay let's try this.

20
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.640
P8: Okay vasculitis island.

21
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.180
MODERATOR: No, do you mind reading the task again.

22
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:10.110
P8: read the text within the home tab in the main panel allowed and explore the data source of your choosing by right clicking and opening it in a new tab.

23
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.860
Okay.

24
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.980
P8: Once you feel you understand where the data comes from please click the button open lab to visualize the density of the data points within the location of interest.

25
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.860
P8: you'll be done when you mentioned a few of the locations of interest that have data points available.

26
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.420
MODERATOR: Okay.

27
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:44.340
P8: So my senses taught us is you got the query explore the resulting linkedin environments or PM the clicking submit.

28
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.330
P8: Export the data, he needs.

29
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.230
P8: Some trying and Castle, the first instruction wants to read the the what's that what I see.

30
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.860
P8: And then explore the data source of your choosing by right clicking and opening it in a new tab.

31
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.520
Okay.

32
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.430
P8: yeah.

P8: Oh yes, okay so.

36
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.750
P8: So think i've done big parts of first question.

37
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.610
P8: Once you feel you understand where the data comes from please click the button open map okay.

38
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.240
P8: visualize the density.

39
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.130
P8: So currently seeing the map of Ireland.

40
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.540
P8: My county works fought.

41
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:37.770
P8: Okay that's really nice, you can see the pollution measurement what would, I think some pollution measurement with a number.

42
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.390
P8: Number six and the weather one data point density seven.

43
00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:05.100
P8: So texting then use aquarius is just magically saved in the APP locker for the history of your query for selection you'll be able to use this far, to get the data directly through an API and the future data can.

44
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.490
P8: So you see the same number.

45
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:20.970
P8: county Waterford pollution number two where there's zero that data points density and to them.

46
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.640
P8: So there's a scale here, going from cold to warm.

47
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.230
P8: Just play around with this.

48
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.070
P8: there's a zooming in and zooming out.

49
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.930
P8: So.

50
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.290
P8: I need to figure out whether to.

51
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.240
P8: The scale the once the call to one scale and refers to the map itself.

52
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.530
P8: Just kind of play around.

53
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.760
P8: With the options yet plot the log mark.

54
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.830
P8: which takes you to a different link.

55
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.980
P8: dash enterprise download for him.

56
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.530
P8: down on form million times per month, so it seems to be a platform for plotting.

57
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.430
MODERATOR: something about bite is a Python package.

58
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.810
P8: Python acute.

59
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:39.780
P8: Care so the next one, is to goal showed close it data on Harvard just going to click and see what happens.

60
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.800
P8: So i'm just going to go through all of them, so there is done, not the plot.

61
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.810
P8: which has like.

62
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.540
P8: Take a picture image.

63
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.560
P8: So you can take a picture of the map like an image.

64
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.870
P8: You can pan.

65
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.160
P8: Okay, so for navigating the map.

66
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.650
P8: box select.

67
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.050
P8: Okay, so you can.

68
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.230
P8: select all this is really cool.

69
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.130
P8: Because select sections of the map that you're interested in.

70
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.120
P8: less so.

71
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.830
P8: select click it and see what happens.

72
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:40.590
P8: Okay, it seems to all care it's less triangular I mean Celeste rectangular.

73
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.980
P8: So you can be more selective the map is not okay three.

74
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.470
P8: Okay, gives you more control, but we chose a counties you interested in.

75
00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.610
P8: Okay.

76
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.360
P8: Well that's really cool.

77
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.610
P8: And then you've got the zone mean she's swimming in something art.

78
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.790
P8: And then you got reset view.

79
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.280
P8: Okay recent you texted back to the whole night.

80
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.180
MODERATOR: So, can you tell me what the data comes from.

81
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.940
P8: So.

82
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:52.590
P8: This was when I made the query I said anchor vasculitis island.

83
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.980
P8: So what I.

84
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:04.620
P8: assumed this corresponds this aggregated data by region.

85
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.830
P8: And it refers to aggregated pollution.

86
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.900
P8: levels.

87
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.910
P8: And the weather.

88
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:26.640
P8: measurements for that region, what a query was anything specific to time, so the time is 2020 so.

89
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.590
MODERATOR: But you you haven't gotten anything, yet this is the home view.

90
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.150
P8: Okay okay.

91
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:43.230
MODERATOR: And I wanted to ask you, so in task one bears and once you feel you understand where the data comes from so what's the data source of weather pollution and iris on data.

92
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.710
P8: Oh that's a good question.

93
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.700
MODERATOR: Tell me, what are these data control.

94
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.430
P8: So the weather data seems to come from the Irish which your logical.

95
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.960
MODERATOR: That that's.

96
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:17.610
P8: Okay.

97
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.480
P8: Sorry i'm just probably terrible.

98
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.730
MODERATOR: structure it's fine it's fine it's fine.

99
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.490
P8: The pollution seems to be coming from.

100
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.900
P8: The Environmental Protection Agency.

101
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.830
MODERATOR: Okay.

102
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.430
P8: She seems to be specific, for island in this case because it's islands environment.

103
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.420
Okay.

104
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.470
MODERATOR: it's fine it's fine you can go to the next task.

105
00:11:50.880 --> 00:12:02.490
P8: can stop the next task, submit a query using the input options available in the query tab on the Left non most panel.

106
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:17.640
P8: systematic way, using an input options available the query tab the Left last panel, while you're selecting the query options, please explain a lot specific choices that you make it you make choices, as you make choices.

107
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:26.310
P8: new ones will become available for you to select once you reach the end, please click submit button once.

108
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:38.400
P8: which will be available invalid inputs are being selected you'll be done when a new tab name q1 is displayed on the main panel the dashboard.

109
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.830
P8: Please only select one.

110
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.910
P8: So the seems straightforward.

111
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.570
P8: So we've got the query here on the Left instructions was.

112
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:09.750
P8: submitted queries got top rate diseases that i'm interested in this case i'm just going to take this away.

113
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:23.400
P8: Suddenly saw a look looks like only have ankle vasculitis island is the only rare disease options i'm going to take that input they've entered interest.

114
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:33.900
P8: In this case, this is referred to they're just going to click in the information, but to see what they.

115
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:44.340
P8: Act vasculitis was is the pathological confirmation treated with immunosuppression escalation and cynical responses same.

116
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.920
P8: Okay, so somebody was active vasculitis.

117
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.340
P8: If he's still pathological confirmation that's been confirmed by through okay.

118
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.620
P8: treated with it's been treated with immunosuppression.

119
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.500
P8: And then escalate it.

120
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:15.120
P8: To be treated for clinical response Okay, so the high probability set to active strathclyde is supported by suggestive clinical features by chemistry.

121
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:28.290
P8: c reactive protein, creating a new area, you can radiological investigation treated with immunosuppression escalation and clinical response, the same, but without is logical confirmation.

122
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:36.960
P8: Active possible active vasculitis on physician assessment, but limited supporting laboratory logical.

123
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.590
P8: To do personal aspirations okay that's really nice.

124
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:49.830
P8: So a flare can be divided into three category definite option high probability and possible.

125
00:14:52.470 --> 00:15:05.790
P8: So i'm just going to click and see what happens here Okay, then you have to choose whether you're interested in those who've had either definite high probability possible or none.

126
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.770
P8: Okay that's that's really interesting.

127
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.080
P8: Someone choose okay.

128
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:25.980
P8: Just kind of click away the information, so it gives you as as what seems to be a.

129
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.870
P8: An event of interest for date.

130
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.010
P8: So you got a lot allocation of interests, which is.

131
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.960
P8: This case.

132
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.120
P8: i'm just going to click this away.

133
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.160
P8: And then some.

134
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:04.410
P8: Okay i'm just gonna ignore the map for now, so you got the location of interest Kevin now and then you have.

135
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:23.370
P8: An event date, then you got the different ones now okay so within each location you got different day event dates just humor first two different people can Okay, so you can get to see just the raw data.

136
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.730
P8: Okay, so.

137
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.000
P8: i'm gonna ask click.

138
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.790
P8: i'm just going to click one other option high probability see what happens.

139
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.780
P8: So.

140
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.470
P8: let's go back to the first one.

141
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.320
P8: Okay, so it seems like you get more more events.

142
00:16:54.690 --> 00:17:01.920
P8: So it seems to combine the events for definite high probability.

143
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.360
P8: As more.

144
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.550
P8: event date seems to be appearing from the raw data.

145
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:22.830
P8: i'm assuming this can somewhat click these two and then go to the location of interests.

146
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:43.140
P8: and say i'm gonna go for Dublin we just choose safe just choose one for now okay so it's Nice that you can select multiple locations, so I go for coke and one more location say Galloway Galloway.

147
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:56.370
P8: So assume, so it gives you a country options island, so I wonder if you need to click this for can just gonna take it away so.

148
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.160
MODERATOR: Be understand why you click diagram.

149
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:10.350
P8: I assume, if you have multiple countries let's say you had the United Kingdom, you could flick maybe whales.

150
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.140
P8: But that's that's the assumption that i'm making.

151
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:28.140
MODERATOR: Okay, if it's not clear it's completely fine it's easy to do and do it just for you to understand afterwards.

152
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.100
Okay.

153
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.580
P8: Okay, something not click it and then pick a period.

154
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:45.150
P8: side seems to give you an option, starting from August 2020 so i'm just going to click first of.

155
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.510
P8: All so first of August 2020 and i'm gonna go.

156
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:02.640
P8: Until and say it gives you between August 2020.

157
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:09.750
P8: Okay, you can can choose any particular date so I assume we can go from the first of.

158
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.680
P8: So i'm just gonna go first of May.

159
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.530
P8: Until.

160
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.970
P8: and say i'm a God till November.

161
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.900
P8: November 20.

162
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.170
P8: Data source gives you an option to choose either the way, there are the pollution.

163
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:38.880
P8: So i'm just going to go pollution, because i'm always interested in that, and then give you the temporal units.

164
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:49.260
P8: Within information I like to click this information, the data will be combined and aggregated at the Foreign temporary unit okay.

165
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.930
P8: So i'm interested in let's say daily.

166
00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:02.880
P8: let's see if it gives me an option to choose monthly so you can only choose one option at a time okay so that's good.

167
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.660
MODERATOR: So from.

168
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.170
MODERATOR: From data sources can choose one option or multiple options.

169
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:18.570
P8: Can just check okay that's nice oh that's really, really nice I saw efficient, so you can look at both the weather and pollution.

170
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:30.990
P8: So for temporary unity, can I choose one which makes sense because it doesn't make sense to combine different time points and then saw.

171
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:38.070
P8: spatial temporal aggregation Okay, either we want, whether you want to display the mean.

172
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:52.710
P8: see if you can choose the mean, so this is the aggregation you can choose between mean minimum and maximum so let's see if she can select Okay, so you can only select one, at a time.

173
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.400
P8: Just makes sense.

174
00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:12.180
P8: yeah I was still be nice to have maybe if you can have all these three, but you can always query them separately, but yet keep in mind nicely efficient to maybe have all three.

175
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:19.920
P8: Okay, so i've gone through so i'm just going to review what querying.

176
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:39.210
P8: So i'm going to be querying rare diseases, so events on ankle vasculitis flare interested in the flares that what definite and knows what that were had a high probability.

177
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:56.370
P8: Then i'm looking at three locations of interests Kevin coke callaway and then i'm picking from first of May until the 28th of November, looking at the weather pollution, then looking at monthly mean.

178
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.030
P8: yeah for my query.

179
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.070
P8: So.

180
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.480
P8: I guess don't need to do anything with the map.

181
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.780
MODERATOR: You want to read them of the task to.

182
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.290
P8: me just have to submit.

183
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:23.100
P8: Account once you reach the end, please click submit the bad ones which will only be available.

184
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:36.960
P8: invalid inputs are selected you'll be done with a new tab name q1 is display on the main panel the dish dashboard so i'm going to submit.

185
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.570
P8: seems to be loading.

186
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.490
MODERATOR: You would start reading task created one.

187
00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:09.000
P8: explore the two one tab in order to understand the table underneath there are two buttons that help you interpret the data table Jeff did you see click both buttons on top.

188
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:21.090
P8: Open query input summary and often color table description commenting allowed on the usefulness and clarity as explanations.

189
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:32.490
P8: then read the texts in the data sub tab and talk through the interpretation of the variables itself background colors read red and blue.

190
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:46.350
P8: Of the data table can select the columns that you want to display the toggle columns button that that you can you can scroll vertically or horizontally and use the page arrows on the right.

191
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:54.990
P8: Bottom corner to check the amount of data to query by scrolling you'll be done when you feel you have sufficient explore this table.

192
00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.710
P8: So explore that she won tab.

193
00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.100
P8: Which is so you've got a home to be called the comparative tab now I see.

194
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.580
P8: Instead of saying, she wanted sister she.

195
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.190
MODERATOR: Doing I think up boys really fast.

196
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:14.820
MODERATOR: But go ahead.

197
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.770
P8: Okay.

198
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.490
P8: um the case so it seems to have the tab open tears.

199
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.560
P8: instruction is.

200
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.530
P8: In order to understand the top tier one or two buttons that help you.

201
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.210
P8: interpret this data.

202
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.510
P8: table that you see click both buttons on top.

203
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.810
P8: Name open query input summary.

204
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:46.290
P8: OK, so the open query input some reason top and open color.

205
00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:53.430
P8: table description okay so they're, the first thing that you see on top there in.

206
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.810
P8: Like.

207
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.400
P8: yeah.

208
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.560
P8: Green color and then commenting out loud on their usefulness and clarity is explanations so i'm just going to click one.

209
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:17.100
P8: So the open query input summary key underneath gives you two columns one that says options others says input.

210
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:25.440
P8: Under options, you have rare diseases event of interests location of interests and data.

211
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:38.970
P8: input, you have ankle vasculitis island definite type of opportunity Okay, then Okay, so that you selected so basic summary of what you requested, and then you can go to.

212
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:49.590
P8: The second part, which is OK period time be aggregation so provides a nice summary of what she requested.

213
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.210
P8: And then open qualitative description.

214
00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:25.560
P8: So the table colors seems to be at the bottom of the of the open query input summary, so the table colors as a data table playground, so if the data is normally distributed 95% should be between minus two plus two Z score, which shows white summa white color.

215
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:42.630
P8: values that are above two are considered high and which are labeled with the red color values that are less and minus two, I know, and I labeled with a new color.

216
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.910
P8: So that was the first task that makes sense of the.

217
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.810
P8: two options that makes explanation.

218
00:26:53.670 --> 00:27:09.330
P8: yeah seems to be good kinda just shows you what you requested, and there are no confusion, sometimes you maybe click things to fascinate don't cannot actually explains what were the different options.

219
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.190
P8: Oh yeah.

220
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.840
P8: Men gives you an explanation about the.

221
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.530
P8: The colors that you're going to see.

222
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.740
P8: OK, so the instructions go.

223
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:45.480
P8: commenting out loud their usefulness and clarity is explanation, then read the text in the data sub tab and so data subtype so data okay.

224
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.990
P8: Sometimes you can just below that.

225
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:59.850
P8: and talk through the interpretation of the variables and salt backgrounds stop background colors red and blue the data table, you can select columns that you want to display.

226
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.480
P8: With a total columns but.

227
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:15.480
P8: Not that you can scroll vertically and horizontally and use the page arrows and the right bottom corner to check amount of data required by scrolling you'll be done with school yes.

228
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:26.610
P8: Okay, so you got it okay so you've got the data sub tab at the bottom you then you've got the time series, then you got the box plot and you've got the Paula plot.

229
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:41.700
P8: The first instructions to go through the data's sub tabs the full name of the variable will sync with the universe appear when hovering over the headings of the data table for further information, please refer to the data source links in the home tab.

230
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.440
P8: For the please refresh the data sources link in the home tab Okay, the first the first.

231
00:28:50.130 --> 00:29:06.240
P8: The first one tablet I was looking at which shows that the way the day Okay, the total columns button allows to select columns of interest and an export button to download the data csv file to your computer only the visible columns will be downloaded.

232
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:08.790
P8: Okay.

233
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.370
P8: So you got Togo column, which gives you.

234
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:23.610
P8: options of year time yeti month and it gives you the different okay pollution.

235
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.290
P8: There was a chicken you want to take the temperature.

236
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:37.590
P8: Okay it's just shows you what's in a table so she's and selected sam's can select.

237
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.680
P8: One of them same month okay disappears.

238
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.170
P8: And then comes back, we have selected okay that's very cool.

239
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.710
P8: So you've got the year 2020, then you got the month in numbers 567 to level.

240
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.300
P8: three.

241
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.500
P8: And then you got.

242
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.880
P8: Okay that's really cool.

243
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:29.010
P8: So you've got the numbers which the columns which white slightly light Gray okay so just a normal table.

244
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.050
P8: And then within each each column.

245
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.330
P8: Okay, you can order them.

246
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.200
P8: You can order them by higher low.

247
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.680
P8: And then it changes the table accordingly.

248
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.820
P8: Okay, so it makes sense to just order them a year and then a month.

249
00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:05.760
P8: So, looking at 2020 may the PM 10 was 10.9 5.9 so can so forth.

250
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.760
P8: You can scroll to the right and left and see sun.

251
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:37.140
P8: So shine duration hours okay that's really cool so when you click on each column heading shows you the variable and shows you the description and the units that the song so and Satan does case some of these things done on wt SP is mean Ali wind speed in katy units.

252
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:47.910
P8: Then you got the msr mean sea level of pressure in each Pascal units okay you got VIP which is.

253
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.960
P8: vapor pressure okay that's really cool okay so provides description and the units.

254
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.710
P8: And then, if you go to.

255
00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.890
P8: For example, to the bottom.

256
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:14.250
P8: you've got in November, the PM 10 levels in micro can cubic meters.

257
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.260
P8: You had above.

258
00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.940
P8: Highland high values of above to.

259
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:30.840
P8: own some interesting so just trying to figure out why this one is labeled rates and others are not.

260
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:33.900
P8: So.

261
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:40.470
P8: His table background data is normally distributed 95% should be between.

262
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.600
P8: minus two sets of okay it's the status quo.

263
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.600
P8: And it's a tough one.

264
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.270
P8: So this refers to the.

265
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.790
P8: Whether there's a normal distribution or not.

266
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.410
P8: So values that are above to will show rate.

267
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.750
which indicates.

268
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.050
P8: Potentially.

269
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.380
P8: Okay valleys.

270
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.820
P8: which shows that says codes probably high.

271
00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.230
P8: indicating maybe okay and indicating.

272
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:32.340
P8: That generally PM 10 was probably towards the high in November.

273
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.050
P8: So it's skewed towards the right basically.

274
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.080
P8: Okay that's.

275
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:47.130
P8: Actually doesn't refer to the value itself is just refers to was the direction of the of the design school.

276
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.280
P8: OK, so the instructions, then.

277
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.470
P8: I think the tables nicely structured.

278
00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.170
P8: All the units I explained.

279
00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:04.980
P8: Quite Nice, and then the last thing you can select the concert, you want to display.

280
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.130
P8: So i'm just going to try and export.

281
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.610
MODERATOR: You don't see it while you're exporting into my computer but i'm going to construct with second.

282
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:20.490
MODERATOR: Time.

283
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.430
P8: So export.

284
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.910
MODERATOR: Some don't don't click again because you're downloading this data into my computer.

285
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.550
MODERATOR: Okay, I was canceling it.

286
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.920
P8: i'm just gonna take once.

287
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.980
MODERATOR: No, no, no, no, like, if you like, you're loading data to my computer like you.

288
00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.220
MODERATOR: there's a window pop up that says, what do you want this to be.

289
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.470
P8: OK OK, so I basically when they export.

290
00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:52.800
P8: Given this toggle column.

291
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.010
P8: It exports everything that I said.

292
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:57.570
P8: Okay.

293
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:05.130
P8: let's just realize okay so i'm gonna feel like I understand that parts.

294
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.090
MODERATOR: Yes, perfect.

295
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:15.600
P8: So the next instruction is to explore the other tabs beside the data table data tab or three plots.

296
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:24.150
P8: Time series box plot and polo plots interactive features for different purposes, please use those features for each plot.

297
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:37.020
P8: One mentioning the usefulness of each one in understanding the environmental data will be done when you have you explored through the interactive features for each of the three plot taps.

298
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.290
P8: Okay, so we're going to explore the other tabs some start with time series.

299
00:35:44.550 --> 00:36:01.650
P8: The visualization is interactive plot zoom cover single multiple pan and download this PNG they can click the variable to the select to do select and Double Click to select only.

300
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:10.110
P8: Rain slide I click and drag to select the period of interest on the bottom plot.

301
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.070
P8: So i'm just gonna play around and see.

302
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.020
P8: Okay, so i'm just going to start.

303
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.270
P8: So you got to can download the plotters the picture.

304
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.140
P8: You can so mean you can pan.

305
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:45.000
P8: You can zoom in and out, you can auto scale, you can reset axes so i'm just gonna start sitting with.

306
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.780
P8: You can toggle spike lines.

307
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.150
P8: To sister.

308
00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:09.300
P8: And then gives you that other option that you saw compare data on hover and then compare that okay so that's the one show closest state and hover okay.

309
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:18.600
P8: So I see the month of the year that I selected and I see the values okay that's that's interesting so.

310
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:23.160
P8: So when you.

311
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.000
P8: When you go to just going to play around.

312
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.310
P8: So when you click around July it gives you all the values.

313
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:47.340
P8: For the different variables that you see, so it gives you the color codes you got the rate, which is the variable msl it tells you the first of July and then values, not point five same thing temperature.

314
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:56.730
P8: Men and paper you got these values, not point eight 1.81 would.

315
00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:00.390
P8: Be not counted three so on.

316
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.670
P8: So we just assume refers to the actual units of the.

317
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:15.270
P8: Actually, so these numbers might not correspond to the actual units.

318
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.630
P8: Or does it.

319
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.400
P8: may be true, first of this call.

320
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.240
P8: Maybe i'm assuming this refers to this is called because.

321
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.100
P8: This is the two units can vary around July it's much more warm okay.

322
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:41.790
P8: let's interesting OK, so the value here actually refers to the Cisco as previously discuss okay.

323
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.230
P8: So, then you can.

324
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:57.420
P8: So the instructions you got below that you got date time which is sort of squeezed in smaller craft at the bottom.

325
00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.100
P8: Can.

326
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:06.000
P8: So interactive features for different please use those features for each product was mentioning the usefulness.

327
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.850
P8: yeah so.

328
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:22.740
P8: My day I mean yeah I can understand why it might have been nice to put it on us at school, because one of the ways to normalize right because all of these come different units.

329
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.620
P8: plotting them Allah says call.

330
00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.250
P8: Just shows you how the sort of distribution.

331
00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:35.640
P8: So you've got.

332
00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:48.120
P8: For example, PM 10 which goes up and down, so it goes to chris's between May and June and sort of comes down Marcus and then.

333
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.660
P8: It goes back up.

334
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.070
P8: Can you got so i'm just going to try and click.

335
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.660
P8: So when you click the variable.

336
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:16.830
P8: Okay, so i'm just gonna see if I can remove and assuming you click on it, you is sort of removing it to the graph so you can click one by one, so you got rain.

337
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:26.940
P8: And I still got a so too, so i'm going to try and move it okay that's cool that's what I once i've been able to few one, at a time.

338
00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.900
P8: So you got Karen goes up.

339
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.250
P8: With the discourse relatively low.

340
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:41.610
P8: stable and and cost up to July August September goes down and comes back up.

341
00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.330
P8: And let's assume this refers to the rainfall.

342
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.530
P8: So I might just pop back so i'm taking along this.

343
00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:04.800
P8: surrender first to them precipitation amount in millimeters something okay.

344
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:09.210
P8: Okay, so you can do the same.

345
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:18.810
P8: Okay that's all that's just what I wanted to see, and then you can move that and then click let's say 10.

346
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:28.710
P8: Okay sort of course in winter and then goes down on someone picks up again.

347
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.910
P8: In autumn back went OK.

348
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.890
P8: OK, I expected that.

349
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:44.250
P8: PM 2.5 follows the same pets and expect that so to.

350
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.750
P8: All goes up from.

351
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.010
P8: Throughout summer comes down.

352
00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.480
P8: To okay that's very cool to seeing.

353
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.730
P8: Just okay.

354
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:04.950
P8: Anyhow, so.

355
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.220
P8: You can get to the last interview.

356
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.850
P8: So i'm just going to go the box plots.

357
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:21.540
P8: So it shows the value, which is also serves as it's called stone and then it shows you the different variables.

358
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.380
P8: yeah and then it shows you the median.

359
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.530
P8: Churches terms the median score.

360
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.790
P8: Local town apricots and the minimum.

361
00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:37.410
P8: So you can see something like.

362
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.090
P8: The rain.

363
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.600
P8: Just have these two extremes.

364
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:49.290
P8: So.

365
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.520
P8: tend to be similar distribution.

366
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.590
P8: And to SF to test is.

367
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:24.210
P8: sort of similar million okay so, at least for the box plots bouncing aqr divided by the medium and the Turkey style whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 times I cured beyond the box user ization is interactive plot zoom hovers think of my pen download is okay, so you can download this.

368
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.870
MODERATOR: Okay, I want to concentrate on local time.

369
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.930
P8: So the polar plot.

370
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:44.880
P8: scatter plot the plot complex variable wind dependency so that's the description, the radius length indicates the one speed and a decrease.

371
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.380
P8: The one direction, there was a realization is interactive.

372
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.110
P8: So you can.

373
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:59.100
P8: plot so zoom hover same thing and download his picture so i'm just going to select.

374
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.510
P8: who's gonna earn interest so, for example.

375
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.490
P8: Okay, so.

376
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.430
P8: let's suppose the case so you got this blue thing that.

377
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.470
MODERATOR: that's for me that's.

378
00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.200
MODERATOR: A 10 maybe try nobody.

379
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:24.330
P8: Can.

380
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:33.120
P8: Can I can just going to play around see if I can put to the same time Okay, so you can I look at one of the time.

381
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:43.770
MODERATOR: In there is an error, and I think it's because you pick twice when you quit so i'm going to look at it afterwards, if you want to go to the next task or try, maybe temperature.

382
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.480
MODERATOR: Okay, but.

383
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.240
P8: temperatures, can I be some way.

384
00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.480
P8: Just scoring too fast Okay, I was gonna say temperature.

385
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.630
MODERATOR: yeah we'll fix it i'm Sorry, I think it was you click on it, thank you for discovering that, though.

386
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.010
Okay.

387
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.750
MODERATOR: You want to move to the next task.

388
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:40.980
P8: So the next task is creates to new queries after you have submitted them following the same instructions that to you'll see q2 q3 ethnic tabs on the main panel Now you can compare them prepare to tab is greed greed in Texas tab and select number of groups, you wish to lag and click.

389
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:51.990
P8: On click to generate groups and new input spoke will appear underneath our NGO queries into groups and check on clip to plot groups.

390
00:45:52.950 --> 00:46:03.510
P8: Now, new sub tabs will have peer with three different visualizations piece mentioned out loud the usefulness of each one in a similar manner to SIP step three.

391
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:09.150
P8: Okay, I saw student can just go back to new queries.

392
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.030
P8: So i'm gonna come back up here.

393
00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:17.790
P8: So.

394
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:25.650
P8: suck can only look at island somewhere else, then switch around and say.

395
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.590
P8: Look at high probability, this is.

396
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.030
P8: i'm just going to look at high probability for now.

397
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.360
P8: And then i'm going to go.

398
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.460
P8: location.

399
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.710
P8: Where choose different locations i'm going to go some of these bottom ones.

400
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.540
P8: Like squads and i'm not going to.

401
00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.010
P8: default.

402
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.110
P8: click.

403
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.960
P8: from Ireland, and then click.

404
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.210
P8: towards earlier.

405
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:11.850
P8: say.

406
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:17.640
P8: January 2020 and then to.

407
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:19.920
P8: end of April.

408
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:31.290
P8: screen say.

409
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:33.600
P8: Serious.

410
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.780
P8: i'm gonna keep the same look at the way there and pollution i'm gonna look at.

411
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.950
P8: Look at the mean and then compared to the.

412
00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.560
P8: Minimum and then see if I can choose.

413
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.720
P8: So okay just need to decide.

414
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:02.370
P8: yeah so i'm just gonna look at the minimum for now and then submit that is a query.

415
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:17.070
MODERATOR: and explain me, what are you selected ashram this time if you don't have a reason it's fine just for me to understand you know thought.

MODERATOR: Okay.

446
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:53.160
P8: Death of interest, a specific to these locations OK, so the road data.

447
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:59.520
P8: doesn't seem specific so i'm just gonna continue to the dates range.

448
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.300
P8: And then pick something towards the end of the year and say go for.

449
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.170
P8: Go back.

450

P8: December 31 30th.

454
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:39.000
P8: can then keep the weather so as data source pollution temporary and let's not keep the minimum just.

455
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:42.390
P8: Compare.

456
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.820
P8: Women for now.

457
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:58.650
P8: It makes sense to compare like spatial temporal aggregation you know, maybe that has similar sonic keep the minimum since I selected.

458
00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.420
P8: That query.

459
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.230
P8: A hot in summer what's.

460
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.540
P8: That it's okay.

461
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:28.680
P8: create two new queries have done that read the text in this tab and select the number of groups, you wish to make then click on the click generate groups in you.

462
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:37.950
P8: and your inputs PR group OK, so now got a check to us anyway, so should be fine so now i've got.

463
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:44.010
P8: To to Q i'm sorry to keep five.

464
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.710
MODERATOR: it's happened again.

465
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:48.900
P8: yeah.

466
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.520
P8: there's a delay and then you're not sure whether you burning time it's fine it's fine.

467
00:52:55.530 --> 00:53:00.420
P8: So i've got now to in your queries that as sitting next to each other.

468
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:14.520
P8: And all show the same features i've seen other query input summary they at times these products, so what I want to do is compare the groups so.

469
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:27.510
P8: Now you can compare them in the competitive tab read the text of a console need to find the comparative tab okay so called home comparative and then you've got your in your queries.

470
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:40.260
P8: Like take the comparative great data previously submitted in the session can compare specifically or we can combine these queries and groups with the multiple selection inputs potentially increase the signal to noise ratio.

471
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:42.540
P8: Okay.

472
00:53:44.160 --> 00:54:00.450
P8: One decide the number of groups that you wish to compare select the queries that you want to group explore each environment variable the different plots queries are grouped by computing the mean per unit in time that time series parked in the class classroom training.

473
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:11.160
P8: ting ting the values in the box in this plot, therefore, the time series pod has limitation when comparing queries with different tangents.

474
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.160
P8: OK, I see.

475
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:30.150
P8: So the time series plots has a limitation of comparing queries with different time units, so in my case, I chose different time units.

476
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:36.660
P8: Okay, so let me just play around and see what are running to.

477
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:46.590
P8: So comparative tab read the texts select a number of groups, you wish to make someone say to for now.

478
00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:54.330
P8: And then click on click generate groups so.

479
00:54:55.350 --> 00:55:04.950
P8: click generate groups, and then the near impossible group will appear underneath okay so i'm gonna click see what happens.

480
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:19.050
P8: And then so takes you then click George can you inputs PR group or piano nice arrangement your queries in the groups and click on click plot groups okay so.

481
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:25.950
MODERATOR: you're done so, the one on the four out of the ones that you've ever played so just.

P8: Okay.

486
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.920
P8: Then click to generate.

487
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.000
P8: click to generate group.

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:26.400
P8: yeah So the first impression when you get in is that you have like you know, a website with a few simple instructions and not too much information.

568
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:39.960
P8: Because some website just I just saw it just overwhelm you with information so it's like what it does, how to use the dashboard and then this way the data source comes coming from.

569
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.960
P8: And then, it gives you, you can look at things from the map.

570
01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.670
P8: The map at first.

571
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.620
P8: You think see it's color coded.

572
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.410
P8: Based on a scale.

573
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.930
P8: From more from cold to warm and then you.

574
01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:13.350
P8: You i'm just going to zoom in sorry if i'm taking long i'm just.

575
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.200
P8: Trying to play replay the things in my head.

576
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:16.890
Just thinking.

577
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.360
P8: So the color coding of the map.

578
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.790
P8: You think it's corresponds to the map itself.

579
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:34.350
P8: But I think it refers to the zit school for the values that you have in there.

580
01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:40.650
P8: So that was the one thing that was a bit.

581
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:46.050
P8: Confusing at first, because you.

582
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.540
P8: You you look at the color coding of the map for each county and then you.

583
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:57.030
P8: The data point density Okay, so I guess, I should just read this property.

584
01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:12.060
P8: regions so you're trying to make sense of the of the data point density, whether they're referring to them to the map itself the different countries and then you when you click on each country it's Nice that you can see a value.

585
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.980
P8: But you the values you like Oh, does it mean.

586
01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:17.520
Okay.

587
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:28.410
P8: But until you start playing around which is, which is the whole point is that jonah query the data, so you get this the query part is really nice because you.

588
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:47.790
P8: You click the disease of interest you click the event of interest you have explanation of the different categories which is like really nice The self explanatory and then you've got the location of interest, the one confusing thing was you get to have some look at the raw data.

589
01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:49.950
MODERATOR: In terms of.

590
01:05:50.310 --> 01:06:04.260
P8: us assume that each event date probably first to each person or something in an event, you don't show that Professor each person will just you know one person with multiple events or something.

591
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:13.560
P8: But at the end of the day, you looking at aggregated data so maybe you're not interested individual data so that that should be fun.

592
01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:24.540
P8: But then you think so, you want to maybe isolate from looking at all the data to maybe looking at you know specific locations.

593
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.640
P8: From this just brief summary you're not sure whether.

594
01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:30.930
Okay.

595
01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:35.640
P8: And then the date range is nice, you can select what you want.

596
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.670
P8: Maybe it could be nice to have like a little information.

597
01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.500
P8: Okay, but just saying.

598
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:47.550
P8: You know what data is available.

599
01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:50.010
MODERATOR: Okay.

600
01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:52.200
P8: and

601
01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:54.930
P8: The temporal units.

602
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:59.040
P8: That was quite nice it has an explanation.

603
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:09.180
P8: So what would be nice, so the temporal units and spatial temporal aggregation.

604
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.570
P8: So data source temporary units just going to click on this.

605
01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:22.230
P8: So at least yeah gives you an extra explanation.

606
01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:34.050
P8: And then you so what other thing that might be nice is, if you maybe have an option to look at the mean minimum and maximum.

607
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.360
P8: Without downloading them a separate.

608
01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:51.390
P8: folders but I know most a given the Copernicus and many places, you have to download those things separately.

609
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:59.010
P8: And then, so that, for me, overall, this is this is quite nice psych.

610
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:00.480
P8: You.

611
01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:18.000
P8: didn't invent you click and then you have the data and then you then you get your query and then you get the chance to to plot it, I mean given it was my first time I was like figuring out whether you know, because my first instinct was.

612
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:25.800
P8: So you click on your querying this is nice it's actually gives you a summary what you requested, and then it gives you.

613
01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.920
P8: A the road date which is like this is perfect, you know.

614
01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.050
MODERATOR: know.

615
01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:37.830
P8: The visit school.

616
01:08:39.570 --> 01:08:40.530
P8: it's not something.

617
01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:44.160
P8: yeah i'm used to using as much.

618
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:45.690
MODERATOR: Okay.

619
01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:46.740
But.

620
01:08:48.210 --> 01:09:01.650
P8: Understanding it's if it's like you know it just tells you delivers cuteness towards the data right, and most of the if if the data is negative excuse most of the values are going to be towards the left, the lower end.

621
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:09.780
P8: If it's like above certain towards the right the values are gonna be towards hi my interpretation of this was.

622
01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:20.220
P8: just go down my interpretation of the red column just indicate.

623
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:27.810
P8: just indicated, for me, for example, PM 10 was just generally high around the November period.

624
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:40.920
P8: And then the plot, I read that was so much my biggest favorite part actually i'm sorry I missed up your whole thing by.

625
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.080
MODERATOR: Double clicking things in time.

626
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.300
P8: cuz the visualization really like helps you kind of put the data into perspective, you know.

627
01:09:53.610 --> 01:10:04.140
P8: And and yeah it will just give you an idea how your datum it gives you like overall picture of the trend of what you can expect, and this is like just like information on its own.

628
01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.520
P8: Which is quite useful and now being able to like look at each.

629
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:15.090
P8: yeah I mean this is this is great, this is like really.

630
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.420
P8: You have an idea.

631
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.300
P8: What the data looks like.

632
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:32.790
P8: yeah i'm sure if I had gone to daily daily data aggregate data that that even get more information.

633
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.990
P8: Which is quite Nice.

634
01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:41.970
P8: And then, so that was that was nice part.

635
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.760
P8: So all the plots really like.

636
01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:55.230
P8: What most people in the field, I used to is maybe having the role, having separate.

637
01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:03.480
P8: Having separate variables, so what I was thinking, I was going to see was.

638
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:08.400
P8: Basically, this as a box plot.

639
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.270
P8: And just show you.

640
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:25.680
P8: So the values themselves Okay, this is still the Z score, which shows you kind of the Z score should follow the trend of the actual road data right.

641
01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:27.870
P8: Okay.

642
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:35.550
P8: So either way it's just as a way to normalize the data, so you can compare them on the same plot okay.

643
01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:46.650
P8: yeah I mean I mean it's fine I mean, because at the end of the day, you just want to get an idea of the pattern, and she access to data.

644
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.320
P8: If i'm thinking about people in the medical field.

645
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.540
P8: Sometimes they love, they would love.

646
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:10.080
P8: Individual plots for each pollutant but that will just create too much additional work you.

647
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:12.420
P8: Okay, so you could have like let's say.

648
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.930
P8: The actual role values.

649
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.130
P8: On the y axes and then TIM TIM here, and then the different temporal units like.

650
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:24.390
You know the different monkey.

651
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.500
P8: And then you can have option to look at them separately.

652
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:46.830
P8: But at the end of the day, this whole thing is to help people you've integrated the data in the back end and you want to access the raw data and then visually look at it, so I think for me like this is this is perfectly fine the plots really.

653
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.300
P8: give you.

654
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:52.680
P8: give you an idea.

655
01:12:54.420 --> 01:13:06.540
P8: And also like that you can make multiple requests, instead of you have the option to download them individually, but then you have an option to download them as a zip file, which is really.

656
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.450
P8: Much more efficient way of.

657
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.850
P8: of getting this data.

658
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:15.990
P8: So yeah.

659
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:23.850
P8: So the I like the simplicity, I like that you get an extra option to just look at the data briefly.

660
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.560
P8: There I guess the minor things is is just.

661
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.520
P8: You know the thing about the event dates.

662
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:33.780
And yeah.

663
01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:37.770
P8: But it's it's really nice album.

664
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:40.290
MODERATOR: Okay, thank you.

665
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.980
P8: yeah if you've done quite a lot of hard work.

666
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.310
MODERATOR: Thank you so i'm going to stop the recording.
