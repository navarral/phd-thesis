7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:52.020
P5: Once you feel you understand where the data comes from please click the button open map to visualize the density of data points within the locations of interest or you will be done when you mentioned a few of the lies that have data points available so.

8
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.030
P5: So retention text within the home tab.

9
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.890

P5: Let me just check okay.

11
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:19.890
P5: The sc dashboard heights the complexities in linking clinical rare disease data with environmental observation using knowledge graphs the desired outcome is to support health that are researchers identify appropriate environmental variables.

12
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.320
P5: To enable their hypothesis exploration in researching our diseases, how to use the dashboard one selecting submit query inputs on the left.

13
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:45.300
P5: to explore the resulting linked environmental data that appear after clicking submit three export the data for your needs text file name user query history dot txt is is automatically saved in your APP local folder with the history of your query input selections.

14
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:57.360
P5: You will be able to use this file to get the data directly through the API in the future data environmental observations have been gathered from the following sources, whether pollution aerosol data right click was opening to.

15
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.570
P5: See data point density click the button hover over the regions to get the number of data points okay so that's the homes have read.

16
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.970
P5: clicking an opening.

17
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.960

18
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.560
P5: So right clicking into a new tab.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.480
P5: So it's a map of where sorry I forgot I clicked on I think I clicked on whether um yeah I clicked on whether so it's the white with the weather data.

26
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.190
P5: kind of from the following sources so.

29
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.860
MODERATOR: Remember what the task is asking just to acknowledge what data come from just.

30
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.820
MODERATOR: You have to go too deep into this.

31

P5: Oh sorry I.

32
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.480
P5: Once you feel you understand where the data comes from.

33
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:37.020
P5: Sure um yeah so it's just yes just wider data Okay, yes okay so okay.

34
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.920
P5: Okay, so let's go back here so says no, I can open my to visualize the data points.

35
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.630
P5: Okay.

36
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.670
P5: Sure, so he's just a bit awkward because.

37
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.330
P5: it's not a problem with the APP it's just i'm working on one screen, just so you know that, for your analysis okay i'm.

38
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.930
P5: Okay yeah I see no that's that's fine yeah I got what's going on here, so this is just whatever.

39
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.720
P5: Actually, what is this data click this.

40
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.240
P5: Okay, so it's just a number of data points right for each for each county okay okay yeah and then the.

41
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.140
P5: Blue so.

42
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.350
P5: Lucian okay so each each stars a tennis racket map I got to see what each how much of each data point there is.

43
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.070
No.

44
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.450
P5: there's a little bit like here I sure whatever okay um.

45
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.630
P5: The otherwise stuff data points available.

46
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.340
P5: yeah so I mean each county I guess they're kind of divided up into counties.

47
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.560
P5: each other number of data points available okay um, so I think that's the first test on so okay yep okay cool um.

48
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.670
P5: So I can submit a query using the inputs, the input options available in the query tab on the left, most panel.

49
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.690
P5: While you're selecting the query options, please explain a load the specific choices, you make, as you make choices new ones will become available for you to select.

50
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.540
P5: Once you reach em please click the submit button once which will only be available invalid inputs have been selected.

51
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:44.190
P5: You will be done when a new tab named q1 is displaying the main part of the dashboard please only submit one query okay so submit query using the input options available in the query tab on the Left okay.

52
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.210
P5: Let me just.

53
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.270
P5: zoom up again.

54
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.880
P5: Okay query yet so that's already there it's been a query isn't.

55
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.740
P5: When you're selecting the correct right, so I can select the options.

56
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.190
P5: So if our solution is rare disease so there's only one option, I could vasculitis that's fine.

57
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.060
P5: Events of interest flare there's a little.

58
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.310

61
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.870
P5: yeah okay now I can okay so definitely high probability possible or no um.

62
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.530
P5: might be good if there was like an option, an option for like all of these I guess.

63
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:56.370
P5: location of interest so yeah this is okay again just what county i'm guessing oh sorry I haven't Okay, I said sounds blacked out because I don't click anything okay there Oh, we can we can select more than one oh, I see okay okay okay yeah.

64

71
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.990
P5: i'm not sure what that means, unless the some of these locations of interest or outside of Ireland.

72
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.530
P5: yeah I don't know i'm gonna stick it anyway, why not.

73
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.010

74
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.750

82
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:36.300
P5: date range I can't go back these are all great out, so I kind of go back further than a certain date, maybe that was maybe I was explained somewhere or say seventh of January until.

83
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.640
P5: Sunday June 2020 until the sixth of August I think there's a bit of like again.

84
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:46.830
P5: up there, we go.

85
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:58.710
P5: And these are the data sources I wants, whether on the same boat, whether i'm solutions, and I can choose what temporal units I want so let's say I want just won't see.

86
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:10.590
P5: And then the aggregation method use Okay, this is pretty handy So what do I want the mean of the monthly weather and pollution or where are the men are the Max of the monthly what our pollution.

87
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:18.900
P5: Or the daily or and so on okay so let's just say the mean Okay, and there is some if I can click some important, so I said submit.

88
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.870
P5: What was another do that, I think.

89
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.320

90
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:35.790
P5: Oh yeah okay so once you raise your hand, please click the submit button once okay that's fine which will only be available valuable selected, you will be done when a new tab name q1 is displayed in the main part of the dashboard okay.

91
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.960
P5: So I think this, this is probably q1.

92
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.790
P5: we consume up.

93
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.250
P5: yeah this is q1 okay cool I think that's the that's task completed them.

94
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.970
MODERATOR: yep.

95
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:58.410
P5: Okay cool tasks on my street exploring q1 tab in order to understand the table underneath there are two buttons that help you interpret the data table that you see.

96
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:10.050
P5: click both buttons on top open query input Sumerian open color table description commenting allowed on their usefulness and clarity as explanations and read the text in the data soap tub.

97
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:16.860
P5: and talk through the interpretation of variables and solid background colors red and blue of the data table.

98
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:26.580
P5: You can select the columns that you want to display with the toggle columns button note that you can scroll vertically and horizontally and use the page arrows.

99
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:38.490
P5: On the right bottom corner to check the amount of data you're querying quick you queried by scrolling you will be done when you feel you sufficiently explore this table okay so explore the key ones hub okay that's fine.

100
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.820
P5: Let me just sorry something just reposition my screen a bit.

101
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.020
Okay.

102
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.670
P5: Okay, so explorer key one tab.

103
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.690
P5: In order to understand this table, there are two buttons to help you interpret the data literacy click buttons on top.

104
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.460
P5: So these two buttons here open query input summary so let's just click this button here.

105
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.070
P5: query input summary.

106
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.920
P5: Okay, so it's just this just repeats okay why what my query was.

107
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.890
P5: that's fine and open.

108
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.480
P5: This the second button here open quarter table description.

109
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.960
P5: Oh.

110
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.210
P5: Oh sorry sorry, a new thing appeared at the bottom there sorry okay table coolers.

111
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:57.870
P5: Data table background if data is normally is no issue 95% between minus two plus two is that scores white okay values more than two are high red values less than minus two are low blue okay so that's that's fine.

112
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.920
P5: Okay, there we go.

113
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.180
P5: Okay that's fine so.

114
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.990
P5: year, so I see there's a year column the month column I selected on a monthly basis.

115
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.040
P5: And then I have all the difference whether variables here.

116
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:22.890
P5: and

117
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:34.710
P5: So these tables are based off right that the yeah so the standard, these are we're assuming they're normally distributed on if they're set scores are.

118
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.750
P5: More than.

119
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:49.290
P5: Okay sorry so yeah I see I see yeah there's that scores are more than 200 if there's that scores are less than minus two then or blue okay that makes sense, so we can easily see any.

120
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.330
P5: outliers.

121
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.840
P5: So, to speak Okay, what else we have to do.

122
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.580
P5: commenting on their usefulness and clarity as well yeah commenting on are useless clarity of explanations, I think the destinations are fine.

123
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.250
P5: And yeah.

124
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:19.710
P5: then read the data read read the text and the data soap tab and talk through the interpretations variable cell background colors okay I kind of already done that you can select the columns that you wanted to display with the toggle columns button okay toggle homes.

125
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.490
P5: Okay, so this lets me okay just display.

126
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.690
P5: Which columns they want so let's say I want to get rid of nfl.

127
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.150
P5: sugar.

128
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:38.430
P5: yeah let's say I want to get rid of them so or order which is rain outs appear want to get rid of temperature.

129
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.380
P5: Okay yeah.

130
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.350
P5: Okay yeah that's that's that seems handy i'm.

131
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.920
P5: Not the scroll vertically and horizontally and use page arrows on the rock right bottom corner.

132
00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.140
P5: These things.

133
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.260
MODERATOR: For me, is for me to monitor.

134

P5: away there we go okay.

137
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.550
P5: says their arrows in the bottom right corner don't quite see them.

138
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.410
P5: You can scroll vertically and horizontally and use the page arrows.

139
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.910
P5: To check the amount of data that you acquired by score scrolling.

140
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.090
P5: Sufficient explore this table okay.

141
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.470
P5: screen.

142
00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.640
P5: There was a.

143
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.130
MODERATOR: Time fine.

144
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.410
P5: Okay that's fine yeah well.

145
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.830
P5: yeah just let you know I couldn't quite find that okay so task for.

146
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:17.580
P5: exploring the other tabs inside the tabs beside the data tab all three plots time series box on polar plot or interactive features for different purposes.

147
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:27.270
P5: Please use those features for each part, while mentioning the usefulness of each one and understanding the environmental data, you will be done when you have explored through the interactive features for each of the three.

148
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.200
P5: plots ABS okay so just just look at each of the plots okay full screen.

149
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.230
P5: Time series.

150
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:36.930
There we go.

151
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:45.630
P5: Okay, so this is fairly self explanatory, let me just read it ties response visual story long time this visualization is interactive.

152
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:57.390
P5: Okay zoom over single and multiple patterns and world as a dot PNG file legends click on the variable to select the select a Double Click is to select only.

153
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.060
P5: Just yeah okay Okay, Nice and then I can.

154
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:11.220
P5: Okay, I can zoom in on a certain feature of it yeah race later click and drag okay so it's all right.

155
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.030
P5: zoom over.

156
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:18.870
P5: oops.

157
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.350
P5: Okay clicking of interest in the bottom.

158
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.860
P5: Oh yeah okay.

159
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:27.690
well.

160
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.410
P5: yeah okay okay that makes sense okay so that's still fairly self explanatory.

161
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.550
P5: box blah okay so it's just a box plot of the data.

162
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:57.270
P5: And let me just read this the box bounce the quarter arranged by the by the median and two key slow Westerners extend to a maximum of 1.5 by the IQ are we on the box this visualization interactive so I can hover over these this gives me.

163
00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.260
P5: And the quintiles and the two key whiskers.

164
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.320
P5: OK, for each variable that's that's fine.

165
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:11.730
P5: Okay cool and I can I can download these things here as a PNG so on okay polar plot.

166
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.190
P5: scatter plot complex variable when dependencies.

167
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:26.040
P5: radius indicates the wind speed and the reason, when direction this visualization is interactive okay so have to select some to make disappear so so that's right.

168
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.370
P5: Okay, let me just read this again scatter plot.

169
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.810
P5: scatter plot complex variable wind dependencies the radius length indicates the wind speed and the degrees of the wind direction.

170
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.520
P5: Okay Okay, so this is this is blowing the wind Okay, so what direction the wind is going.

171
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.550
P5: wind speed and the degree radius and the length of the radius is the speed okay.

172
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.050
P5: And so that you could use this, I guess, to find the correlation between the wind and the rain or the wind and whatever else.

173
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:14.670
P5: So there seems to be more rain and, of course, and then the intensity of the rain is indicated by the heat the heat of the chatter plots.

174
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.110
P5: Okay that's fine in this interacts as well, I can look at all these different points.

175
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:29.130
P5: Of these are all taken a different time so I might also be useful to know like when like on site.

176
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.740
P5: So it gives the wind speed and the rain, maybe if the if the tab also shows.

177
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:41.520
P5: When these points were like if they were early in the year, maybe I don't know, maybe I won't be useful not sure.

178
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.760
P5: Maybe it will be way wouldn't be okay, but either way okay that makes sense, so let me just go back to the tasks.

179
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.750
P5: That was every task, for I think you.

180
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:59.250
P5: Know okay that's fine okay that's number five creating your queries after you have submitted them following the same instructions step to you'll see q2 q3.

181
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:07.170
P5: As a new tab in the main panel Now you can compare them and the comparative tab read the text in this tab and select the number of groups, you wish to make then click.

182
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:19.020
P5: On the click to generate groups born anew inputs PR group will appear underneath arranger queries in the groups and click on click to plot groups now new soaps, new sub tabs.

183
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:25.350
P5: will have appeared three different visualizations please mention allow the usefulness, each one in a similar manner step three.

184
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.400
P5: Okay, so just make some new queries okay so.

185
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.010
P5: Okay, so I can't change these let's just.

186
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.710
P5: Just to be different let's just go for possible.

187
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.210
P5: let's select Carl.

188
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.540
P5: I don't know what I still don't know what that date range.

189
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.910
P5: let's go back to April 1.

190
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.130
P5: To August 1.

191
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:18.660
P5: let's say just whether let's say whether I say daily and let's say a minimum.

192
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.150
P5: submit.

193
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:35.400
P5: that's q2 that's fine and let's say for the q3 let's say, the only thing I want to change is, I also want to look at the maximum.

194
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:37.950
P5: submit.

195
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.020
P5: Okay, so that makes q3 whoops.

196
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.250
P5: Okay that's fine, so I can use the comparative tab, let me just.

197
00:20:53.010 --> 00:21:00.600
P5: Now you can compare them comparative tab read the text in this tab and select number of groups, you wish to make okay so let's have a look for the comparative tab.

198
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.090
P5: curtis.

199
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:18.390
P5: Okay, a query data previously submitted in this session can be compared by specific variable you can combine these queries into groups with the multiple selection inputs to potentially increase the signal to noise ratio.

200
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.820
P5: You can combine these queries into groups with multiple said okay fine so one decide the number of groups that you wish to compare.

201
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.980
P5: to select queries you want to group three explore each environmental variable with different plots.

202
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:47.250
P5: queries are grouped by computing mean per unit time and the time series and concatenate the values in the box and box plot, and in the box and districts are therefore at the time series plot has a limitation when comparing queries with different climates.

203
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.320
P5: So we just have a quick look at the top of the sorry the tasks again.

204
00:21:54.030 --> 00:22:02.490
P5: So read the top task resistance times like numbers group, you want to make then click generate new groups, a new inputs PR group will appear underneath.

205
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.420
P5: Okay number of groups.

206
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.300
P5: 100% sure.

207
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.490
P5: What exactly i'm doing to be on but let's just see what i'll probably figure out what's really.

208
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.150
P5: So I just select the two groups.

209
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.600
P5: Okay, so I can select group one.

210
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:39.930
P5: Okay, so right the groups are the queries okay so let's just say q2 for groupon and q3 for group to.

211
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.700
P5: So the dish The only difference between those is that q2 is minimum maximum yep so let me just.

212
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.060
P5: Say that might be interesting, I guess i'm.

213
00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:02.820
P5: click to generate groups, a new inputs PR group will arrange your queries in the groups and click on plot OK, so now, I can plot these groups.

214
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.910
P5: Alright, so next variables to group.

215
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.890
P5: Okay, so i've got a few.

216
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.390
P5: Okay, so let's look the temperature.

217
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:28.350
P5: Okay, so this is yeah yeah Okay, I see what's going on now so that's just the way of like comparing yeah yeah okay so.

218
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:43.590
P5: Group to yeah so go to his q3 so that was the maximum that's the minimum that's fine yeah and they seem very correlated you will guess, and I can select whatever he wants let's look at the box plot again let's look us rain.

219
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.440
P5: group one rain okay.

220
00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.570
P5: You have a look so yeah so.

221
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:21.570
P5: Okay Okay, so this is me. Okay, so it shows a scatter of the points and and a box But OK that's fine a little bit confusing i'm fair enough um yeah, I think, personally, I would just prefer just the box on its own and.

222
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.880
P5: that's just my preference i'm sure everyone has their own and that's fine.

223
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.390
P5: yeah okay that makes sense.

224
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.760
P5: Okay, just not sure what this is let's.

225
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.390
P5: sum PM PM 25.

226
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:48.420
So.

227
00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.270
P5: that's a glitch or if i'm not understanding something.

228
00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.280
MODERATOR: Remember, which was able to query.

229
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.710
P5: q2.

230
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.480
P5: So.

231
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.500
P5: Creative so the difference between them is minimum maximum so the distance is now.

232
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.510
MODERATOR: What what body what data sources, did you query for quality quality.

233
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.260
P5: And it was the weather data.

234
00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.430
P5: So.

235
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.200
P5: You know it's not i'm not sure what the dist even should be.

236
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.800
P5: yeah okay so i'm not i'm not sure what they said, or I would show.

237
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.650
P5: I was open to pollution data or something else.

238
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.470
P5: Is.

239
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.690
MODERATOR: it's fine it's fine.

240
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.100
P5: it's fine okay okay that's fair enough.

241
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.350
Okay.

242
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:14.640
P5: Okay yeah so yeah the other two were fine I kind of got them and I kind of understand what on here so i'm not even sure what this would even what does even supposed to show, to be honest, so yeah.

243
00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.230
P5: Anyway, moving on.

244
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:28.860
P5: To our sex six choose one of the queries to export q1 q2 q3 go to a tab that the export button from the data table and download the data csv file finally opened the zip download tab on the Left panel and click.

245
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:42.450
P5: On download zip with all data tables to download all data for all the queries submitted during the session as as a file you'll be done with understanding, where its data store okay so choose one of the queries to export and go to that tab okay so let's say I want to.

246
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:52.050
P5: Take you one want to download to you want Okay, I was away, I can download this click the export button at the data table.

247
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.300
P5: yeah so here.

248
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.450
P5: there's an export button.

249
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.160
MODERATOR: Yes.

250
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.450
P5: On your computer.

251
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.790
MODERATOR: i'm just gonna come soon Thank you yeah.

252
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.240
P5: Okay cool.

253
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.020
P5: It makes sense i'm right what's next thing finally.

254
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.970
P5: Finally, opened the zip download tab.

255
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:24.180
P5: On the left side panel to click and download zip with all data table so there's I remember seeing this.

256
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:26.700
position.

257
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.770
P5: Okay, here, that is download is it with all data tables.

258
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.050
P5: stored in our files okay.

259
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:37.950
Okay.

260
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.320
P5: You will be done okay so that's fine um so task seven Finally, could you summarize earlier overall.

261
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:59.130
P5: Your overall your experience in completing these tasks, using the seed, seed dashboard then Please proceed to complete the PS Su Q questionnaire okay so um.

262
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:09.480
P5: yeah, let me just go back in the full screen here yeah it's all fine and this all makes sense, it seems easy enough to get the hang of i'm.

263
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.690
P5: Always back here again so yeah so this.

264
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:14.790
P5: I think it was fairly.

265
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.620
P5: intuitive.

266
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.410
P5: query stuff is good.

267
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.700
P5: yeah i'm not sure what else you got I still don't know this Ireland button means.

268
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.050
P5: Whatever that's fine I, being able to download everything is good.

269
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:43.440
P5: yeah the ui dates, this is kind of Nice being able to see just offhand how much data, there is, and this is nice as well being able to see where the data is like how much data, there is for each county and so on.

270
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:52.320
P5: yeah i'm all the stuff I will it yeah like being able to take the you know.

271
00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:03.330
P5: able to select other time granularity and the aggregation method is good, maybe that like I mean there's older aggregation methods of course older than the main in the maximum mean you could have the median and all that but uh.

272
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:05.670
P5: that's kind of splitting hairs you know.

273
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:24.030
P5: And I don't even know like what are the main is okay, or the meetings Okay, but yeah maybe maybe just a couple more options will be kind of Nice now and the query tables yet they're all falling and so being able to look at your query again just remind yourself.

274
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.070
P5: yeah.

275
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.310
P5: This all seems fine I mean this this is.

276
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:47.700
P5: The one thing i'll say so, this is a these out these outliers are determined by a normal distribution like we're assuming they're only distributed there's no reason to think that these are normally distributed or I mean you know it's not a big deal there might be.

277
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.840
P5: better ways to like identify outliers you know what I mean because.

278
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.800
P5: it's not like I said there's no reason things is normally distributed um.

279
00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.320
P5: But it's it's not a big deal, you know just I understand it's just some kind of quick.

280
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:16.890
P5: kind of way just to see Okay, so any values, who are much lower than we'd expect are much higher than we expected that's fine and it's doesn't it doesn't have to be super sophisticated thing the plots are good yeah the port applause nice actually because.

281
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:25.710
P5: That is something that kind of came up, I know that comes up a bit like wind and that's not something i've ever looked up before, but I know other people have you know what I was.

282
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:40.110
P5: There was a disease in Japan, where it turned out wind was the secret the secret ingredients to figure out what causes so um yeah it's kind of Nice that we're looking at wins, I think this might be important or might not be but it's nice that's there anyway.

283
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:48.180
P5: And yeah the comparative FAB is good, so, in fact, different theories and yeah, these are all fine.

284
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:50.910
P5: Maybe.

285
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.070
P5: Can I select more than one.

286
00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:02.940
P5: Although well Okay, I was gonna say no, you select more than one variable at a time might be handy but I don't know it probably wouldn't be, as I said, with the box part I kind of just prefer.

287
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.170
P5: yeah just an oral blogspot on its own, because that's informative and.

288
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:15.660
P5: I still don't know what this this is supposed to be, obviously I couldn't go to work because maybe I use the wrong word, but I did some wrong, but I.

289
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.070
P5: yeah but even if, even if it was working i'm still not sure why it's supposed to be so yeah that everything else seems kind of fine.

290
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:35.340
P5: And it's not say like working through this it hasn't been super responsive but that's probably because we're working over zoom and i'm controlling raleigh so I can't I can't read your shot fairly.

291
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.370
P5: Well yeah This seems.

292
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.410
P5: pretty good i'm just wondering what order things just occurred to me there.

293
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.360
P5: It might be handy if there was like I know we can select as many as we want here.

294
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.760
P5: Or maybe that's what I heard in those hold on.

295
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.830
P5: Okay, I see Okay, so all if you want all of Ireland, he selects ireland's okay Okay, maybe.

296
00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.320
P5: That could be very clear yeah.

297
00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:58.860
yeah.

298
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:05.580
P5: yeah okay that's that's every no yeah It seems pretty good pretty nicely so yeah thanks.

299
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:06.810

307
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.780
MODERATOR: Okay, can you not click the zoom and click another window.

308
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.680
MODERATOR: let's see if I can, if I can do it this way yeah.

309

MODERATOR: Okay.

310
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.110
P5: yeah.
