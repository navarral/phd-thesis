00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.440
MODERATOR: Now we are recording now i'm going to give you remote control, could you try to please move the mouse around.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.889
P7: The mice.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.480
P7: No.

4
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.040
P7: You can't control to have to take control automatic or two after.

5
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.100
MODERATOR: Okay now.

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.190
P7: Is there was just too late okay.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.470
MODERATOR: Okay, so yeah keep in mind there's gonna be a delay.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.230
MODERATOR: And whenever you feel you're ready, you can start the.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.540
MODERATOR: timer.

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.460
P7: Should I read this in advance.

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.650
P7: is fine.

12
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.930
MODERATOR: No it's it's part of the first task so.

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.850
P7: Okay, please go ahead.

14
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.040
MODERATOR: Okay i'm something in now.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.440
P7: Just reading the instructions are the homepage.

16
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.130
P7: Okay, so it hides the complexity.

17
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
P7: The dashboards hiding the complexity and quite curious what that means okay.

18
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.050
P7: yeah that's i'm not quite sure I got been one of the things that hiding the complexity okay and.

19
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.950
P7: instructions to use the dashboard or look very straightforward.

20
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.870
P7: and

21
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.610
P7: And perhaps if I was wanting those three steps I would put it in kind of bold keywords.

22
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.410
P7: And and those three points, just to kind of.

23
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.400
P7: highlight them, perhaps.

24
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.480
P7: So the inputs pretty.

25
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.490
P7: Clear.

26
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:25.860
P7: Yes, and information around what what what the data on profess to data yeah, I suppose, like data and data point density and those kind of almost footnotes some degree i'm quite.

27
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:41.430
P7: yeah it's the first time, the word data no data comes open health data researchers book The words just yeah it's it's an interest, like the information just appears data and data point density, but.

28
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.170
P7: OK, but and it doesn't really linked to the the kahan information around the.

29
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.240
P7: Well yeah.

30
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.400
P7: Clinical very rare disease data Okay, and just wondering like winners referral reference to data.

31
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.630
P7: Those two points whites and I guessing like on whether pollution or aerosol it takes you to a descriptor yeah okay.

32
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.620
P7: or no it doesn't does it.

33
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.430
P7: just highlighted those three a delay.

34
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.240
P7: And then open up okay i'm.

35
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.960
P7: curious, but the comparative cab I should go there now.

36
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.630
MODERATOR: It will come later.

37
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.210
P7: Okay, so okay i'm clear known this the cell home.

38
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.350
P7: So I want to apply their how to use dashboard steps.

39
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.480
MODERATOR: You might be missing task one the last step.

40
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.770
P7: is sorry or ever put it away.

41
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.630
P7: On.

42
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.470
P7: Hidden document apologies.

43
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.400
P7: warehouse my chat.

44
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.980
P7: i'm.

45
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.690
P7: Sorry.

46
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.390
P7: I think I have a like I have a lag.

47
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.340
P7: Ah, sorry i'm controlling.

48
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.440
P7: that's not.

49
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.750
MODERATOR: I can stop.

50
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.080
P7: For a moment yes.

51
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.420
MODERATOR: yeah, what do you need to do is you need to click in another window in your computer or otherwise they cannot.

52
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.430
MODERATOR: Stop the remote.

53
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.040
P7: And so i'm I know on another window.

54
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.090
P7: You stop sorry with this.

55
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.710
MODERATOR: No, no, I stopped the timer so it's fine okay so.

56
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.140
P7: I just need to get.

57
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.750
MODERATOR: A stop the remote control.

58
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.740
P7: yeah just need to get to the.

59
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.550
P7: let's get the instructions for me again.

60
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.160
P7: Most of.

61
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.900
P7: The screen say.

62
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.570
P7: Okay sorry.

63
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.780
P7: there.

64
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.300
P7: We can take control back possible.

65
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.040
MODERATOR: All yours.

66
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.630
P7: just going to read.

67
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.630
P7: he's going to control i'm just gonna revisit those steps again.

68
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.740
P7: Okay, so yeah i'm ready to open open up.

69
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.570
Okay.

70
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.550
P7: This few.

71
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.060
P7: Oh sorry that was me was it and.

72
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:07.200
P7: Okay, so I want to make a query and, as I move down with me he knows i'm leaving time with me.

73
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:16.500
P7: So the left hand menu is not moving down as I can just observe that map we don't know if that makes an impact just yet.

74
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.390
P7: And I will, I suppose, because i'm submitting a query.

75
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:38.520
P7: So I can have maybe it's me, but I wanted to see the map, but I guess it's not because the disease is the first.

76
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:50.580
P7: selectors element it doesn't have any respect that relationship to the map and maybe location of interest, though I was scrolling down.

77
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.690
P7: And yeah ideally, I would like to.

78
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.990
P7: Have that and.

79
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.000
MODERATOR: And the men explaining me the map.

80
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.510
P7: map looks like it breakfast bread broken down currently on county by county.

81
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.890
P7: Excluding Northern Ireland which.

82
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.040
P7: yeah okay and.

83
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.070
P7: Popular is a population density data point density.

84
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.790
P7: not sure what data oh sorry.

85
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.000
P7: Number of data points yeah well.

86
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.930
P7: Whether pollution aerosol okay and.

87
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:49.470
P7: When it's a combination of weather pollution and aerosol as data and not sure if I see the benefits of highlighting Dublin has a very high.

88
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.900
P7: density of points as opposed to Cork Waterford male seem to have a different shade on.

89
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.690
P7: My my light here.

90
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.980
P7: For your mixing three different types of weather pollution, air assault and.

91
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.880
P7: unusual it's an unusual metric.

92
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.340
P7: Okay, in that in.

93
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.860
P7: to distinguish it by.

94
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.850
P7: This my current thought actually on that okay.

95
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.550
MODERATOR: Do you mind opening with a mouse over the map.

96
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:30.810
yeah.

97
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:44.160
P7: Court pollution seven weather fourth density 11 yes Okay, so the information is is available when you hover but.

98
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.780
P7: I don't know if I would always have, however, on the.

99
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.030
P7: yeah I know the answer is true the instructions highlight hover over the regions but.

100
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.340
P7: Putting weather and putting those two things together.

101
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.090
P7: Okay, and i'm not seeing the benefit.

102
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.220
P7: and

103
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.280
P7: If anything, I would prefer to see two side by side with them individually.

104
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.240
Okay.

105
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.850
P7: yeah.

106
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.530
P7: In terms of metrics they're not something that.

107
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.870
P7: go together.

108
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.600
P7: In my, in my view.

109
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.940
P7: So uh yet the value of this currently it's not something i'm sure.

110
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.400
P7: is necessary.

111
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.780
P7: Basically, sorry if I missed that one.

112
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.860
P7: Okay, so query.

113
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.110
P7: So 1.2910 case or if I.

114
00:10:53.610 --> 00:11:01.800
P7: jumped there i'm just getting into that process and submit a query using the inputs yeah and.

115
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.230
P7: you're selecting please explain yeah so let's go through that started.

116
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.430
P7: To make choices new ones become available okay okay.

117
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.560
P7: So let's begin ballad.

118
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.530
P7: Q on is displayed to a new expecting a new tab.

119
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.680
P7: Okay, one query only so.

120
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.240
P7: i'm.

121
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:37.740
P7: So I started tonight give I give vasculitis was the only option available.

122
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:48.270
P7: Not a problem event of interest, a flare high probability possible no I think i'm most interested in high probability this point.

123
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:51.810
P7: Is there such.

124
00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:00.300
P7: cases and no event, I suppose, would be on i'm curious about understanding what.

125
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:08.340
P7: No means are possible means, as well, more maybe more important because that's something that turns slightly in between.

126
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.260
P7: And so now okay there's a new indoor.

127
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.300
P7: event of interest dates So these are.

128
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.220
P7: i'm guessing Lol is location of interest.

129
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.430
P7: really is just location.

130
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.900
P7: And ev give end date I suppose.

131
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:35.460
P7: A.

132
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:46.770
P7: shorthand and okay it's in year month day sensible approach because it's easier to search.

133
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.550
P7: Under seven tabs of that okay.

134
00:12:51.870 --> 00:13:03.660
P7: So there's a lot of whoa okay so for Dublin it jumped to quite a large page, as opposed to the others, so it actually forces the page up and down.

135
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.880
P7: Okay.

136
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.600
P7: So it's in County alphabetical order.

137
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.610
P7: Quite a lot of cases.

138
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:28.470
P7: So i'm six I can select a county know I know I can't separate county I can look just at the number of cases in each county and the timeframes.

139
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:40.770
P7: So it's just kind of gives me an insight but it's not very select, so I am going to choose, Dublin, because it was quite a lot of cases and might just be interesting to look up.

140
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.780
P7: and

141
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:49.290
P7: I must return to the I need to return to check the date range for Dublin.

142
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.960
P7: And I can I can select more than one county location of interest.

143
00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:03.600
P7: And can I Tony call Okay, so this offers an opportunity to pick county by county.

144
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.580
P7: Okay.

145
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:13.770
P7: Or, I can choose Ireland as a whole or Republic of Ireland, I guess, well it's fine and.

146
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.570
P7: yeah I wonder, would it be beneficial if that was actually the map that I could click on the counties they're.

147
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.180
P7: Just like the location of interest.

148
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.250
P7: From the perspective of trying to go through this one by one, because the MIC drop menu disappears every time you slide one.

149
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:46.440
P7: So i'm sorry Cork it's gone, I have to go again and the good thing is, I noticed that they don't they don't remain in the in the in the selection so that's good okay.

150
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.190
P7: So i'm going to choose iron and actually just I can't choose Ireland I can't okay there's just a delay.

151
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.970
P7: But now the three remain and I don't know if all the others have been added it's sort of like a.

152
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:02.640
P7: i'm not quite sure, and I have.

153
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.390
P7: Three feature twice or something but anyway we'll go.

154
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.490
P7: and

155
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:27.270
P7: Looking at Dublin things happened from 2001 2019 I think i'm only going to be interested in 22,009 team, although it was mentioned that only 2020 data was available so so i'm putting cases of know.

156
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.380
P7: So is there any 29 yeah well, is there any 2020 cases, then I will go with that because.

157
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.320
P7: i'm taking all of Ireland, so it doesn't matter.

158
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.440
P7: So okay.

159
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.070
P7: And maybe i'll just pick a period of time actually.

160
00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:12.450
P7: john moved for me there and so now it's from first of August so yeah so the second half of 2020 so it shows that I can pick a period more easily data sources weather and pollution, where there's out automatically take.

161
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.680
P7: For some reason i'm not sure pollution is not take.

162
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.070
P7: Which i'm not sure why that.

163
00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.860
P7: option is taken one is not correct or is that something that's accidental.

164
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.350
MODERATOR: You clicked one.

165
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.070
yeah.

166
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.790
P7: yeah I think I think I might have okay that's good to know so and then temple units.

167
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.450
P7: Early daily monthly yearly.

168
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:53.400
P7: Based on my understanding, you coined early resolutions might be to course also i'm not sure if they feel guilty of the data a daily read out already resolution daily I think would be.

169
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.340
P7: Fine, and I am going to keep it relatively simple with mean.

170
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.460
P7: spatial temporal and aggregation actually no i'm going to choose Max.

171
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.630
P7: Because that might be a more of a trigger.

172
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.310
P7: You can't choose more than one so it's really singular approach, which is fine.

173
00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:24.060
P7: And i'm at that stage where I can click submit so i'm just finishing step two.

174
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.640
MODERATOR: I think I think you can click swimming.

175
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.220
MODERATOR: yeah.

176
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.000
P7: I am.

177
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:45.240
P7: So the page on the right class disappeared or no it's loading okay.

178
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:53.250
P7: And are the information that was already there so and for q1 top so i'm reading circuitry while waiting.

179
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.990
P7: and

180
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.280
P7: This takes.

181
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.840
P7: weeks.

182
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.890
MODERATOR: Because you selected all the data for all Ireland.

183
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:40.770
P7: Should this take.

184
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.510
MODERATOR: it's it's it's already done.

185
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.550
P7: OK.

186
00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:03.210
P7: OK OK so i'm going to explore this and in order to understand the table, there are two buttons so before I go there i'm going to.

187
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:14.850
P7: floor these two buttons which are meant to give me some information open query input and the open color table description so.

188
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:21.360
P7: Firstly, the open query input summary I clicked it.

189
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.050
P7: Can you page.

190
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.660
P7: Know hasn't taken mentioned the page, as it is expand.

191
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:42.690
P7: So it's called something different it's not deep open query and put summary it's called the query and put summary know the table that's intentional and.

192
00:19:43.830 --> 00:20:01.380
P7: rare disease asking so it's it seems like it's a summary of what I select in some key things I select in the menu are previously, which is still visible to me on the left, so it is kind of repeating information and.

193
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:11.010
P7: it's working period so yeah this information, seems to be a repetition of what i've selected here, and that is still visible so.

194
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:28.560
P7: it's kind of presenting the same thing, but in a new location in a more condensed table Okay, and just just like no difference in name from open and open and then the open color moving on to the second one and.

195
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:40.740
P7: A subsequent table so that actually the first table is still open, I can close that can I yes and data background of data normally dispute.

196
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:54.450
P7: should be plus or minus plus two said scores yes okay and white, so the background will change if not guessing if it was described greater than to read.

197
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.510
P7: Less than two blue.

198
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.660
P7: Okay.

199
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.140
P7: So I think.

200
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:17.160
P7: What does it mean if it is greater than two versus less than minus two and why would read distinguish from blue.

201
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.700
P7: i'm really not on it for a Friday, but.

202
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:35.880
P7: What ends yeah but i'm just trying to think is it is it required that this needs to distinguish is this red need to be distinguished from blue or should they both be a fine or red because they are both.

203
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.470
P7: Outside the two two Sigma.

204
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:48.600
P7: and on VOD significance does minus two and greater than to have and.

205
00:21:50.460 --> 00:22:06.570
P7: Yes, i'll have to look at the results to see what what that means, and so that's the to their accounting load yeah and know that in order again this is called Table colors it's slightly different, you know that not just.

206
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.950
P7: bicycles, is my point my question in the back of my mind, so now.

207
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:29.520
P7: read the text and the data so so okay so as the text particular interpretation, the variables cell background colors yes, can I got going there already and so data, the full name of the variables.

208
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.500
P7: appear when hovering over the headings of the tables OK so i'm going to do that just a.

209
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.160
P7: lag.

210
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.020
MODERATOR: You need to click on the zoom window.

211
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:56.340
P7: Yes, yes precipitation Am I okay millimeters OK, so the units really represent that in when you drop you really need to go and.

212
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.820
P7: To go right to know what okay and.

213
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:11.700
P7: Further information versus data source links in the home tab okay yeah.

214
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.940
P7: Suppose how do I go to the home tab from here, if I wanted to would be my query.

215
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:28.410
P7: yeah you can tap back there so that's Okay, and I wouldn't would be easy if that was home tab was hyperlinked just to make life easy.

216
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.420
P7: and

217
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.240
P7: toggle columns.

218
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.890
P7: it's like the columns interest okay.

219
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.880
P7: Export.

220
00:23:43.050 --> 00:24:01.860
P7: button to download data csv yeah useful, and only the visible columns will be done only visible and if visible based and once Tyler that's that's Okay, so you have noticed there's red and there's blue and I noticed there seven pages, but I don't think i'm going to call beyond.

221
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.150
P7: The seven pages.

222
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:10.560
P7: And quite a lot of columns a lot of columns here and.

223
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.920
P7: And i'm going to run through them quickly.

224
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.820
P7: yeah the year month day seems to have an annotation of tea after it, which i'm not sure.

225
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.210
P7: Of angst T ran.

226
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:28.800
P7: yeah.

227
00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.320
P7: yeah precipitation.

228
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.780
P7: temperature.

229
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:40.860
P7: degrees Christmas together as greasy from memory for knows can get air temperature.

230
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:49.800
P7: wet Gilbert tennent creature so there's a slight difference between the two, I always use our hitch relative humidity.

231
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:55.590
P7: As are haters more common in noted percentage vapor pressure.

232
00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.230
P7: Pressure so it was quite a lot of.

233
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.140
P7: sunshine hours okay.

234
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.560
P7: Yes, and these are based on.

235
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.130
P7: This is an Ireland as well, so this is a.

236
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.570
P7: combination of everything, this is an average of national figures which probably.

237
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:36.960
P7: creates yeah Maybe my approach to doing a national level or news for fee is his ability.

238
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:48.120
P7: and trying to think about some of these parameters actually their their value in terms of.

239
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:54.060
P7: announced date I don't know and.

240
00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.480
P7: yeah some of these new okay pm.

241
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.870
P7: Okay okay okay.

242
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:14.940
P7: One thing I suppose i'm just curious about is that don't hear it to choose whether and pollution and aerosols just mentioned to I don't know if aerosols are being classified as PM or not.

243
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.070
MODERATOR: No for this version so.

244
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:17.820
Right.

245
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.860
P7: Okay okay.

246
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.620
P7: Fine yep okay.

247
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:38.580
P7: Good so the columns that you want to explain the toggle okay so columns I as I can, I can reduce a lot so things like visibility.

248
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.760
P7: Close height.

249
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.570
P7: not really too worried about the rest yeah fine I can remove that.

250
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.670
P7: hold on.

251
00:26:53.880 --> 00:27:01.080
P7: Eric remove them I have removed them it's just there's quite a lot so yeah I want a lot of this information.

252
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:12.900
P7: it's better to be there, then not to be there, so to speak, i'm curious to see when I download it will the this whole highlighted element feature Probably not.

253
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:29.970
P7: So it's kind of like as a stage of all function is that you're downloading data, then the the requirement for the being highlighted, maybe it's a way to just identify where to download but.

254
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:40.740
P7: Currently, this is just data so really I don't think it's necessary perhaps okay and vertically and horizontally so yeah I think of scroll.

255
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.300
P7: Through that yeah so that's point three complete.

256
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:57.900
P7: For explore the other tabs beside the deal card so i'm curious about these other three time series start there okay so.

257
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.110
P7: zoom hover.

258
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:11.670
P7: Okay, so there's a lot of information and i'm assuming this is based on the data and the previous.

259
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:21.030
P7: slide it still includes what i've excluded from the toggle so that's okay and.

260
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.120
P7: directly to the choices made and the data i'm.

261
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.810
P7: just going to read the instructions interactive features, please use those features.

262
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.340
P7: Okay, so a lot of different information.

263
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.510
P7: Value here.

264
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.370
P7: Is value so i'm guessing everything's been normalized.

265
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:48.780
P7: or.

266
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.340
Not.

267
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.190
P7: minus five to 10.

268
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.600
P7: Maybe after read something I missed.

269
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.480
P7: Variable to D select yes, I can't do that in range later.

270
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.050
P7: Okay, so.

271
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:41.790
P7: that's more interesting for me to play with turning things off so i've used a ring the slider just to kind of start looking at some items know the scale hasn't changed, so the minus five to 10 has been maintained for the so the six month period governs the scale.

272
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:52.950
P7: Which know at the moment no I can't see you know it's not I can't I don't believe I can stretch the that aspect anymore, I can stretch the vertical plane.

273
00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:01.650
P7: Which kind of pros and cons and not if I could stretch the vertical I could.

274
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.270
P7: zoom might allow me to do so.

275
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:18.270
P7: No, it still maintains 10 minus five so you don't get that kind of fit understanding of the of how things are going there.

276
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.960
P7: And lot easier kind of standard.

277
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:31.740
P7: Okay, so legend i'd like to turn off some of these like the thing items that I wasn't interested in earlier.

278
00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.830
P7: cloud visibility climate.

279
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:41.040
P7: yeah.

280
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:55.350
P7: quite an extensive menu here to juice on nearly and and I think yeah there's so many really that the time series it's yeah useful for export plot.

281
00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:04.350
P7: But I would want to be able to manipulate the vertical axis if, for example, had a smaller range of time, but I wanted to focus on like like I have right now.

282
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.490
P7: You need that that range can hide information and also i'm not quite sure of when I.

283
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.670
P7: And I said, Mr up what the.

284
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.950
P7: Whole it's been normalized or standardized standardized.

285
00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.970
P7: My missing something there i'm not sure if.

286
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.170
MODERATOR: it's expensive.

287
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:31.260
P7: And so that's it for time series moving on to the box plug.

288
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.600
P7: Okay cool and this is a box plot.

289
00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.200
P7: Experience median whiskers extends.

290
00:31:44.430 --> 00:32:00.960
P7: Point five IQ or in the box now I am a bit rusty, why not enough sure, but the 1.5 most met and can think of the logic behind why 1.5 and and.

291
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:20.700
P7: Maybe it's a slow day and my stats and but so i'm visualization is interactive correct and I can hover zoom etc same kind of functionality as last time don't have the bar across the bottom, but then, oh no it's not necessary, so value here so yeah this is definitely.

292
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.290
P7: The normal life standalone.

293
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.950
P7: standardized yeah.

294
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:33.870
P7: Think.

295
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.510
P7: and

296
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.810
P7: Again, maybe i'm only interested in some of them So how do I remove some.

297
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.130
P7: As the last leg was really good hideaway like remove that.

298
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.630
P7: yeah some aspects that are just not interested in.

299
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.080
P7: I notice, I can zoom which is great.

300
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.310
P7: And, but I can't select and actually create ago.

301
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:00.870
P7: When I want.

302
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.980
P7: Okay, again, the scale, then that skill move i'm trying to mature.

303
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:20.040
P7: Because currently that go one that stretch, more significantly, the zoom really doesn't, allow me to zoom where does it I know it does sorry.

304
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:21.720
P7: Okay.

305
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.880
P7: yeah no I those.

306
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.780
P7: bit of sensitivity to it, I mean.

307
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.270
P7: And still find yeah hold a turn off somewhat beast.

308
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.660
P7: yeah how do I can't do that i'd like to turn off some of them.

309
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.860
P7: Again it's yeah and lastly porter quite.

310
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:54.210
P7: select OK, so I can i'll take a pollutant it's more interesting me 2.5 letters PM 25.

311
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.760
MODERATOR: that's I will explain later.

312
00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:03.690
P7: No problem Okay, so this is a distribution with respect to.

313
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.670
P7: When.

314
00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.950
P7: speed.

315
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:10.200
P7: And direction.

316
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:19.380
P7: For the whole country actually so my logic of picking the whole country doesn't really make it so useful a lot of zeros.

317
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.300
P7: lot of zeros which surprises me.

318
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.460
P7: and

319
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.480
P7: And nothing within the zero to one at.

320
00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.950
P7: I did pick daily values that I.

321
00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:43.080
P7: do so that's where the resolution would have an impact.

322
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:48.300
P7: The daily might not capture the variation across the.

323
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:58.320
P7: And so okay so there's a wind speed and guessing there's no metric for that i'm guessing it's kilometers per hour.

324
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:18.810
P7: Typically, though, when speedo would be dealing with meters per second I can't remember in your table if it's meters per second or kph and I typically deal with meters per second it's not the end of the world, but the metric isn't here, which makes me kind of wonder what's going on and.

325
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.910
MODERATOR: You want to hover over the blood.

326
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.770
P7: So I can.

327
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:34.050
P7: So I can pick individual points and look at individual points.

328
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:42.150
P7: So much going on in here, though, that I wouldn't even know what to do, maybe my my my my data I picked too much.

329
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.970
P7: But yeah you can so you can see when speed when direction point.

330
00:35:49.200 --> 00:36:02.010
P7: or curious, can you can you download this specific raw information as a or you can just download this PNG file or jpg or PNG is just not the data with it.

331
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.750
P7: would be a nice bonus I guess.

332
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.710
P7: And the colors it I i'm not sure if the colors help or not.

333
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.240
P7: Coming coops and the zoom zoom.

334
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.160
P7: zoom.

335
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:36.180
P7: zoom is working for me.

336
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.620
P7: up that I just don't.

337
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:53.340
P7: seem to zoomed in and either no I yeah okay 32 to 42 so i'm actually got a very specific ring yeah not quite sure what i'm doing with this.

338
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.440
P7: doctor as an analysis method.

339
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:15.750
P7: Good visualization but not sure what i'm going to use it for in my spirit in my area and that's for darn I think it's very yeah so create two new queries Okay, so you need to create two new query so i'm going to be less ambitious with my queries.

340
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.310
P7: Change high probability to possible just curious.

341
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.790
P7: On click Ireland.

342
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:31.290
P7: and select and cork i'm interested in court, because even higher.

343
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.960
P7: data sources again want to keep my time frame.

344
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:51.330
P7: Okay 30 30th of September Okay, and when I.

345
00:37:53.160 --> 00:38:09.540
P7: mean i'm just going to select mean this time now i'll keep to Max there's any comparison logic for comparison so there's going to hopefully be faster so absolute q2 q3, so I think we'll just pick a different county the same.

346
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.770
P7: Okay.

347
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.350
P7: let's cue to look up.

348
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:30.930
P7: yeah okay i'm doing the exact same for changing county in Dublin, because there's a big theater.

349
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:38.910
P7: And same date range, to see if there's any links between the two.

350
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.250
P7: sleep ice change.

351
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.340
P7: Rather than Cork when she's carry.

352
00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:48.960
P7: Your brain.

353
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.730
P7: see if the two counties of any sort of link.

354
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.830
P7: In results.

355
00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.530
P7: and

356
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:05.850
Okay.

357
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:17.910
P7: So, with all that information I have my q1 q2 and compare them the comparative cob, so I think yeah I want to compare those two.

358
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.580
P7: Compared to top okay.

359
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.840
P7: So number of groups.

360
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.900
P7: Okay, so it's an up and down at a time, then you there it's so.

361
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.390
P7: Creative.

362
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.550
P7: can be compared yeah so created two and three purposely to compare.

363
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:55.110
P7: you combine these crews and groups okay so compare pins time.

364
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.730
P7: timeframes event.

365
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.140
P7: location spatial temporal really.

366
00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.240
P7: Okay okay.

367
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.360
P7: or different time periods within the same county.

368
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:17.880
P7: or a specific yeah okay there's a lot of different variations, you could do.

369
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:34.860
P7: And alone, but you can combine these queries into groups to potentially increase the signal to noise ratio signal to noise ratio is in language i'm already familiar with, I guess, but it would be a term that I would appreciate a.

370
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:37.740
P7: definition for.

371
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:44.280
P7: And can appreciate, though the noise side of things, but maybe not the signal.

372
00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:55.110
P7: Besides, the number of groups Jewish yeah selective queries you want to to do explore each environmental variables so click to generate the groups.

373
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.740
P7: And oh so actually I was.

374
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.800
P7: Actually, no I want one group.

375
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.540
P7: and

376
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.210
P7: I don't want to produce something wrong there.

377
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.060
P7: So click to generate groups not good work firsthand what you didn't click property so it's good.

378
00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.950
P7: group, one should be good question too.

379
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:25.590
P7: and

380
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.170
P7: Question three so basically comparing two counties same period.

381
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.800
MODERATOR: Okay, make sure you understand what our group is.

382
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:45.990
P7: database.

383
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:49.590
P7: queries.

384
00:41:55.230 --> 00:42:00.090
P7: Yes, for combine the two queries of question correct query to query three into a group.

385
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.870
P7: To increase the signal.

386
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.750
P7: Which to compare oh yeah can I compare county with Harris county.

387
00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:15.990
want.

388
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:22.350
MODERATOR: To combine combined between groups know between queries.

389
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.920
MODERATOR: I need to make it clear.

390
00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:27.780
P7: Okay.

391
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.610
P7: queries are grouped.

392
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.620
P7: main per unit of time in the time series plot.

393
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.590
P7: Some taking the two counties.

394
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.130
P7: merging them so to reach on almost.

395
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.770
P7: combination.

396
00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:07.920
P7: Constant.

397
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:13.440
P7: Trading constraints myths belt, I think.

398
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.300
MODERATOR: concatenate.

399
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:16.620
P7: Oh.

400
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.800
P7: i'm not familiar with concatenate in.

401
00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.310
MODERATOR: touch after so you have everything.

402
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:24.720
Okay.

403
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.470
P7: Now, also never, never came across town.

404
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:29.940
MODERATOR: i'm going to use another one.

405
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.290
and

406
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.320
P7: Not quite.

407
00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.740
P7: Yet so i'm happy with creating a group with to queries.

408
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:52.290
P7: Unless i'm doing some.

409
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:59.040
P7: and combining the queries into groups i'm quite combine two counties, to look at a region of the country.

410
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.120
P7: Now so i'm happy with that okay.

411
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.850
P7: I believe I am and.

412
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:14.580
P7: click to play plot groups yeah so well if it's group it's only one group, though, is that sufficient.

413
00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:18.300
MODERATOR: Go ahead.

414
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:20.730
P7: um.

415
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.580
P7: fringe groups.

416
00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.560
P7: wants to interest.

417
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.560
P7: So I have.

418
00:44:50.880 --> 00:45:00.870
P7: groupon which is combining the two counties or China, close to December and again that can stretch.

419
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.240
P7: it's useful.

420
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.340
P7: Can I do more than one variable.

421
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.680
P7: And maybe that's where I need more than one group.

422
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:22.200
P7: Okay that's fine OK OK, I can update that I assume I could create the second group yeah.

423
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:24.690
P7: Let me do love.

424
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.550
P7: To okay keeps going back to that refresh menu which.

425
00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:40.860
P7: and

426
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:58.320
P7: select a new one, so Actually, I want to compare the country with the two regions so group group two is actually not a group it's well it's a group in itself because it's all of it, so I can achieve it there, but I think i'll get away with it and.

427
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:03.180
P7: i'm at a better time.

428
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.620
P7: Okay, great PM 2.5.

429
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:16.530
P7: So allows me to check the two counties supposed to the rest of the country for PM to end sorry I sent out to.

430
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.230
P7: I want this question don't have a.

431
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.200
P7: Specific time period okay.

432
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:35.100
P7: group one blue representing two counties, the rest, the core countries so card and carry.

433
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:41.070
P7: As to who's doing much presenting less pollution.

434
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:50.310
P7: What does that mean, though, in terms of triggers So if you could separate like counties that had no triggers on ones that did have triggers.

435
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.160
P7: You can compare it in that way, perhaps.

436
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.140
P7: And so the box i'm just loving cricket the box and distribution.

437
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:07.770
P7: box same thing okay so today's game i'm selecting the metric.

438
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:18.510
P7: In nh menus are not selecting PM 2.5 and then going and looking at it in different ways as automatically.

439
00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:31.620
P7: or automatically it's asking for a manual way to do it, so this This is great point and to its most well okay there's there's there's very significant values here now, this.

440
00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.180
P7: Customer what this is called, and this.

441
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.340
MODERATOR: loud.

442
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.020
P7: yeah.

443
00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:51.180
P7: For me, for me, it's like it is preventing the the box plots from being extended to the magnitude that they're at is there a way to switch them off.

444
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.430
MODERATOR: My.

445
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.510
MODERATOR: You might go well.

446
00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:08.460
P7: Okay i'll be interested to be able to turn it off, so the scale, so I could actually look at PM and great that I can hover over it and see all the different key values related to that the box plot there.

447
00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.050
P7: that's good.

448
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.260
P7: And lastly, distance.

449
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.970
P7: game and just going to pick on PM because.

450
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.700
P7: personal interest.

451
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:22.470
P7: So.

452
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.360
P7: Okay.

453
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.820
P7: and

454
00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:31.170
P7: So so comparison distribution.

455
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.530
P7: Okay i'm trying to think what this tells me.

456
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.380
P7: This is significant.

457
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.950
P7: This is Dr Levi us.

458
00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:59.490
P7: Okay yeah to this i'm not too sure if the value of this, because this is basically six months and summer to winter PM 2.5 would really be quite some some yeah this kind of distribution isn't a useful thing in the context of.

459
00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.360
pollution.

460
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:12.090
P7: don't believe things that keep relative humidity or might not when a certain realistic range might be okay, but you're not going to have a normal distribution of a lot of.

461
00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:19.140
P7: The variables that you have, and maybe wins being wind direction, although you might get a kind of a.

462
00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.300
P7: Two PICs okay.

463
00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:29.370
P7: So to your visualizations yeah usually the usefulness of the distribution of not seeing it.

464
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.480
P7: OK to.

465
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.300
P7: choose one of the crews to export.

466
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:41.460
P7: So go to that tab so I have to go back to the tabs and select something to to export.

467
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:49.560
P7: Something correctly.

468
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.750
P7: and

469
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.310
P7: This is a note here choose.

470
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.570
P7: OK so i'm on that right tab let me scroll.

471
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:19.260
P7: choose one of the greatest export go to that tab and click the export button from the data table, so I have to go back to the okay so okay at go back to that table click export.

472
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:21.060
MODERATOR: And what happens with export.

473
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.980
P7: It could be a big file that's fine.

474
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:27.090
P7: And then I will go to zip download and download.

475
00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.140
P7: Now you've done with understanding, where the data is stored, so I just pretend.

476
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:34.890
i'll click.

477
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:43.800
P7: Yes, if Donald in local folder name APP files so it's creating a new folder on my drive.

478
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:48.000
P7: yeah okay it's not going to my download folder.

479
00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:52.920
P7: Okay, and something i'm used to.

480
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.370
P7: It just goes to my downloads folder on my designated download folder.

481
00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:01.770
P7: OK, and then, finally, could you summarize wherever your overall experience and completing these tasks.

482
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:16.200
P7: yeah generally okay probably a rush to little bit times was my own fault for not reading the instructions and few instructions just need clarity.

483
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:19.530
P7: And that.

484
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:27.540
P7: yeah i'm not quite sure about all of the plots like the district normal distribution plot and it's fine you.

485
00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:37.170
P7: Probably great that there is so many variables wondering if the columns versus table.

486
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:47.040
P7: Traditional to have all of these horizontally, but when there's so many, I wonder, because it's a data to your really.

487
00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.630
P7: yeah trying to debate, why do I need to see all this.

488
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:58.800
P7: F, really, the main objective is to download these one so it's good that you can plot, and so on.

489
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.200
P7: Okay.

490
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.420
P7: and

491
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.350
P7: yeah so.

492
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:15.600
P7: One thing i'm kind of thinking about is this advent of interest.

493
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:27.990
P7: And the link because currently have been just looking at environmental and climate data without really appreciating this aspect.

494
00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:30.540
MODERATOR: Within us towards.

495
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.270
P7: So that's the bit that, and you know these dates I looked at them, but.

496
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.030
P7: The joining the dots is not.

497
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:43.020
P7: Currently there for me so that's a really um.

498
00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:48.060
MODERATOR: Okay, so i'm gonna stop the timer i'm going to stop.

499
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:50.790
MODERATOR: The remote control.

500
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.030
MODERATOR: And i'm gonna stop the sharing.

501
00:52:55.110 --> 00:53:07.500
MODERATOR: So yeah basically your last input is what i've been told that I missed, so what I improve now is that, instead of giving you agree with all the time, serious i'm going to give you.

502
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:19.980
MODERATOR: The average from the event and some days back so, for example, if there's an event the 10th of January new 110 dates back your and you have multiple events you're going to manage all of them.

503
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.180
MODERATOR: In if i'm.

504
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:33.780
MODERATOR: So I was missing this tempura link I was doing it manually but I realized this because I always use this type of data that I have it in mind it's not as useful when combined with clinical data.

505
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.540
MODERATOR: yeah what the end user, you can compare the affiliate sleds against know flares example.

506
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.230
MODERATOR: yeah and you could be your and then i'm going to be actually do the linking.

507
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.530
MODERATOR: So I have the quality ready for the next for the next version.

508
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.280
MODERATOR: Okay, and thank you very much, and when.
