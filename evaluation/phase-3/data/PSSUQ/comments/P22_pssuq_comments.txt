    2 -- Comments. Speed is a slight issue- but this is thinking more of large query datasets. A message is given to indicate this. For 6 events, the search took maybe 20-30 seconds? What if there were 600 or so events? Advice on how to run larger querys would be useful in addition to the message already given.
