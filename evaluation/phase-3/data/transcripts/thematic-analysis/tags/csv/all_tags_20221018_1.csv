2,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Dataset structure clear,"So the example ... event day, it was in February and the following columns have the variables, environmental factors. The temperature and the other variables like precipitation, solar radiation and many empty data."
3,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,So it is uploaded but I haven't seen it yet.
5,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,No I don't have to pick any of the linkage purpose options I suppose.
4,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,I don't understand this paragraph.
6,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,"So, it depends on the purpose I can choose if the events are for my specific example or season-alike if I want to share it with others. I suppose this is that. Okay, now I select the one for me."
8,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option unclear,"Okay, to choose from an area within a certain distance I suppose I do not have enough details at the moment to select that."
9,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,I will choose within an area.
7,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,"Region levels, NUTS ... Okay if I click here and choose Switzerland I will see the different NUTS. Ah okay, Switzerland is here, okay. Okay, so now we will choose CH05 for St. Gallen. So I can come back and select NUTS-2."
10,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,Temporal units month and aggregation method the sum.
11,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"So now I can link the data, Oh something is going wrong."
12,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,I don't know if step 2 is ongoing or finished.
13,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,MODERATOR: In the first step you have uploaded the example table and not your table because you clicked the upload data table button. You will have to upload it again.
13,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: In the first step you have uploaded the example table and not your table because you clicked the upload data table button. You will have to upload it again.
14,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,MODERATOR: You also missed to select two options from the linkage options.
14,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You also missed to select two options from the linkage options.
15,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,"So drag and drop, I can select the file here. I hope I have uploaded the correct file but it does not say anything."
16,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,MODERATOR: You have a message right below it.
16,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You have a message right below it.
17,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload clear,"Oh okay, with this message I can go to the next step."
19,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,Oh but I did not prepare the metadata file for this.
18,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: No problem, you can use the example."
20,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,"Yeah, I have completed this ... NUTS-2 ... month ... sum ..."
21,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage process clear,Okay now it is working.
22,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,"Within an area CH05, I will get all the data. It will not be only St. Gallen I suppose."
23,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage process clear,"Okay, I can see it is also loading step 3."
24,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Export output error,"Okay, now I have to export but I already clicked on the link. Do I have to do it again?"
25,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: I think it did not work. Could you please show me the table you imported?

26,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Technical web issues,"Sure, I will reshare my screen. Can you see it now?"
34,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Oh, I see the length of your time window is 30days and you have selected months. So you get a single data value or none. Do you mind resharing your screen and then I will resume the timer?"
36,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Temporal unit not viable,"MODERATOR: Oh, I see the length of your time window is 30days and you have selected months. So you get a single data value or none."

27,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Export output error,"Sure, okay now if it is working. Export output. But I do not get any output."
29,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Did you get any pop-up window after clicking the button because I could not see it due to your Zoom settings.
29,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Export output error,MODERATOR: Did you get any pop-up window after clicking the button because I could not see it due to your Zoom settings.
28,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Export output error,I clicked on export output but nothing happened. I am checking downloads and I do not see anything.
30,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Okay let's try to refresh, link and export again because it should have popped up an export window. The last query seemed to work because I can see it here but maybe the SUM is not working, I am not sure I will have to check."

38,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Export fine,I can see a zip file here.
39,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,Oh I guess I can input my event file now. I will check if it is a .csv file because I am not sure. I will upload the correct one ... upload .
31,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data upload confusing,MODERATOR: If you click the data table button you upload the data table in the example not yours. You will have to refresh the website again. Apologies I need to include a message there mentioning that you don't need to click the button if you had already input your own table.
31,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: If you click the data table button you upload the data table in the example not yours. You will have to refresh the website again. Apologies I need to include a message there mentioning that you don't need to click the button if you had already input your own table.
40,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,"So now I have my csv file uploaded, and I will be using the metadata file from the example because I don't have one."
32,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage option clear,"Okay, within an area ... NUTS-2 ... day ... mean."
33,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Linkage process clear,"Okay, it's good it works!"
41,P1_GMT20220711.odt,CSV output clear,"It seems like you have a lot of variables, no missing data, the events here with the dates."
44,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Data table structure confusing,"I have 3 patients but in the output I have 4 patients, why is that? Did it take into account my CSV file? I think it was only 3 events/patients when I uploaded my data."
43,P1_GMT20220711.odt,CSV output clear,"Let me check that. Oh no, I had four. It is fine. I asked for 30 days so that is why I have November, December and so on."
42,P1_GMT20220711.odt,CSV output clear,"Yeah, okay it seems pretty good, that is one file."
45,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Do you mind going back to the tasks?
46,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Dataset structure clear,"A, B, C and D and then you have the dates, the lag, which I suppose is 30 days ... 30 rows for A. For B, the same but I never get the full 30 days, it is 29 or 28 ... Does the month influence the number of days? The columns are fine and the colours are explained here."
47,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Filter table useful,"I have to put A to search for event A, oh I see I have only the A now."
49,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Dataset structure clear,"So here, I have them in blue."
53,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, each line is a variable and I asked for 30 days and that is why I have from 0 to 30 days."
52,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Plot clear,"If I want to select one variable in the plot, let me see. Okay, I understand now."
50,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Plot clear,The columns correspond to the weather changes.
51,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Plot clear,"Z-scores, yes okay."
48,P1_GMT20220711.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",It has changed a lot from the previous version.
54,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, here I can select the individual events: A, B, C and D."
55,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Plot not clear,"For D, I do not have any line, I don't understand."
56,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Confidence in using the data,"Yes, I am confident."
58,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Confidence in using the data,I suppose I need to read the report with more time to read the details so I can be more confident in using the data.
60,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Complete output,"No, it is really complete."
61,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Complete output,"You have all the csv files, the interpretation in the html file, so for now I do not have any other query."
62,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Complete output,I suppose if we are going to use other variables we have to estimate the other variables with the available data. But it would be done later on the analysis.
63,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Complete output,My impression is that it is really complete.
64,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Usable tool and data,It is usable.
65,P1_GMT20220711.odt,Real use case application,"I would like to use it in real conditions to see if there is something lacking, but the first impression is that I have everything available for the analysis."
66,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"You provided a description of event here, just a comment but putting an asterisk which is almost like a footnote or something. because at the moment I am developing terminology around principles. It is good to have a clear link between this and this so it is not out of sync but it has a purpose."
67,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,Not sure if the wording of that first sentence ...
68,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,I like the temporal and spatial aspects but it is probably more scientific in language but it may be space there.
69,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,This is kind of the location and timestamp ... Just notice the word POINT comes up but I note that the location point is a different term that the one previously used
70,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I would like to click to see the example. Okay, it is a spreadsheet, tabular form data ... I don't know if this is external or part of the platform but some of these do not have units. This needs to be clear as the temperature could be Kelvin or Celsius which could change everything."
71,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Complete output,"Other than that it seems fine, in terms of preview and download different datasets that are available. I am guessing you can download it as CSV or other options but I am not going to go there."
73,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text consistent,The language is the same which is good to see the consistency between the interface and the output.
74,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,The only thing I would think of is that the metrics are missing there.
75,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"So if I remember correctly this is like what it does. Yeah, okay I am thinking if there is a way to put coision into this like putting 1, 2 and 3 here. Just to show that when you come down here that is what Iread exactly"
76,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,"Okay, so step 1, step 2, step 3 ... very nice flow to it."
80,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload clear,Okay so you can export the sample which is very good so you don't have to start from scratch.
81,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload clear,"I suppose that this is why this export is permitted, very good."
82,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload clear,"Yes, the naming of the file is not an issue when exporting the table."
83,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload clear,When uploading the table I guess you can import any file but I won't test that just yet because the scenarios might have to do with that.
84,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,"For example, the format Iam importing the data. There is no reference for the type of file ... Does it have to be CSV, EXCEL or another format that is accepted. Old versions of excel like version 3 which sometimes people save files as. You can choose from conversion options."
85,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"So linkage seems to me the word that is used but I would probably like to see ""event"" and ""environmental"" featured here. Because for me I had to go back and remind myself of it."
86,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,"As a first time user Ineed to be very transparent, but as a fifth time user, this is second nature."
86,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Usable tool and data,"As a first time user Ineed to be very transparent, but as a fifth time user, this is second nature."
87,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Environmental is not featured here at all so you might want to add ""linking event and environmental data""."
88,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,Something like this around step 2 terminology.
90,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data protection important,"Yeah, these are the ethical aspects going on. I assume that the data the person has is personal data so it makes sense having it there."
89,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,I don't know if the last sentence serves any purpose though.
91,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data protection important,I know that when you are processing personal data you need to be very transparent and comply with the ethics.
92,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Rigid linkage purposes,Are these purposes the only possible ones or examples? Are these the only options you can undertake with this platform? So it is either to conduct analysis or prepare it for an open data repository.
93,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,Metadata input there are recommended and minimum options. That is okay.
94,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,"I would have to figure out what this section is in terms of the minimum. Okay, here it is."
95,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,Season-alike dates is a term Iam not familiar with. Imight need a footnote or tooltip with a definition or clarification.
96,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Unless it is seasonal, but if there is a difference it definitely needs clarification from a researcher point of view."
97,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,"Oh yeah it is here, so it is seasonal I think. But it has a spatial component."
98,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,"Oky, this is something more around the risk of re-identification of an individual. Somehow the way you are producing the data ensures anonymity. That is my interpretation but this sentence is quite a sentence."
98,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Oky, this is something more around the risk of re-identification of an individual. Somehow the way you are producing the data ensures anonymity. That is my interpretation but this sentence is quite a sentence."
102,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I am also trying to think about this so, this step 2 is about linkage options but this is almost a warning, caveat or constraint."
99,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,I feel it is a constraint. It could improve the way it is written  by using bullet points with specific titles at the start of each sentence with an explanation.
103,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,Like a constraint almost.
100,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,I would be curious how much this would affect the result. I will choose as input because I would be trying to conduct data analysis.
101,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,But then I assume that if I was trying to deposit the data in an open data repository the season-alike would be the preferred output. That is my interpretation of what I am getting.
104,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,I don't know if there is almost a need for step 2a and 2b.
105,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,Where 1 is about is about conducting data analysis and you keep it nice and clean.
105,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text consistent,Where 1 is about is about conducting data analysis and you keep it nice and clean.
106,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option to limit others,I don't think they would like to do season-alike for data analysis.
107,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option to limit others,"Then, asking if you want to conduct data analysis or prepare data to deposit in an open data repository. Just a viewpoint."
108,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,Within an area or distance ... it depends if it is an urban or rural environment ...
109,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,I think it is getting from A to B ... Distance would be probably more appropriate but I would have to think about that.
110,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data available comment,This is the maximum resolution but I think this is due to the data availability.
111,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,I want to start clicking on these but I can only select one. I don't want to mess with the system just yet. I will play with that later.
112,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Usable tool and data,"Okay, it takes from seconds to minutes, that is very good."
113,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Usable tool and data,The outputs are pretty straight forward. I am very familiar with FAIR.
114,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data protection important,"I am curious about whether the graph files are ready to be shared because I can conduct data analysis and would have to meet these criteria already. Unless anonymity still exists in the end, so I am curious about this."
120,P2_GMT20220714.odt,open tag,It is not necessary for data analysis. I am trying to interpret where data analysis begins and where linking the data.
121,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,I don't know if Ifollow into the HDR definition but I at the same time I would find this useful.
121,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Researcher's expertise,I don't know if Ifollow into the HDR definition but I at the same time I would find this useful.
118,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,I would find it useful actually because I would come from the environmental data side.
115,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I would add ""environmental data background"" in the scenario."
122,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data protection important,"Looking at the platform, again I am trying to imagine what it would change if coming from an individual or population stamp point, in terms of data. Especially anonymity etc."
123,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload clear,"At this point I would probably like to upload the dataset that has been provided, even though it might be the same."
127,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,One thing that I don't have is the description of some of these but I don't know how important that would be.
126,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,There are no descriptors of the column names.
125,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,"The length of the event is 14 days and a lag of 7 days, I am not sure about that completely."
124,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,I don't know if other formats would work but I trust the developers.
129,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data table structure confusing,it says uploaded so this would be another way of uploading the file.
128,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,When I dragged and dropped the success message was different so I am not sure if I have repeated the process twice.
130,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,I probably don't have time to do both of these but I will choose data analysis.
131,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text consistent,The warning message is very helpful here.
132,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text consistent,Okay it is very good and I change between the purposes so that is great.
133,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,The terminology is different here.
134,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,"I would prefer recommended metadata ... Okay, where did this come from? Unlike the previous step where the table was there this was not available to me."
135,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Task confusion,"Hold on, so task 1 is complete actually? No? I might have to ask what I have missed."
136,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,So what I end up doing is exporting the metadata file and importing it if that is what is required.
137,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Data upload confusing,"Okay, so I could have dragged the table I had just exported."
138,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,"When I clicked on recommended ... Yes, this is a bit tricky ... If I would have explored the platform already ..."
139,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"There is a lot going in step 2 ... You need to upload a file. Then, go through all of this, which is quite intense or hopefully with not many changes. Then, come back to the platform. So this could be in the middle if I wanted to do a quick analysis but it serves the function."
149,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option unclear,"I suppose options yeah, what are these options? Are they to do with case and season or others? I am going to go as input because I am not sure what is season-alike dates are."
150,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,I am going to go with distance as a preference. Okay I got an option for distance in km. I am going to choose a 10km radius unless this can cause problems.
141,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,I would usually say long/lat instead of lan/lon.
151,P2_GMT20220714.odt,open tag,"I don't know if this small dataset will take long. I always like to start small and then, meaning is always good."
152,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Additional features,"Ah! I can only choose one aggregation method. I wish there was a (s) so I could select more than one. That way Ican actually, I suppose I want to do data analysis so the more outputs I can get, the easier my life is."
153,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,"And so, the link button is key and ... technically the task is completed once the spinner stops."
143,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Export output error,Unfortunately my button is not working

144,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Export fine,"Sure. Okay, now it works. It must be a glitch."
145,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Export output error,But the export button does not work ... nothing is downloading
148,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Maybe you need to refresh the web there as you linked twice the data. Then, you could fill again all the options quickly"
146,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Technical web issues,"Okay, I will refresh. Okay upload the table, the metadata that is already there."
147,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,"If the metadata is already there by default, this is a suggestion that you have to upload. Okay I will select the same linkage options ... and link"
155,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,I don't think the link success message was there when linked the first time. So when the message does not appear the link was not done correctly.
156,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Filename not good,"Okay extract all, zip file. I had an interrupted action about the length of the file being too long to export."
157,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Filename not good,"I might be wrong but the compressed name and the name of the files, all of those have lots of characters. They are rather lengthy."
158,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Usable tool and data,"I have 4 excel files and 2 ttl and 1 e-report which I think is the html. I have a lot of options here. It basically has several different excel files which I will open all briefly, individually."
159,P2_GMT20220714.odt,CSV output inconsistent,I don't know if it is possible to have them all in one excel file in different tabs.
160,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Output content clear,"This is a lot of the air quality, this is more the raw data with the events A, B, C and D."

167,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Okay, the lag, okay so this is based on the query information and the initial dataset when Iasked for 7 days of data. So the dates reflect that."
168,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,"Okay, so we could analyse this, but I need to think on the analysis approach to analyse this data. But that would be for another thing. It is clear that there are some data gaps."

177,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,"Because the other files are not definitely as useful as the interactive report, which is by far the most valuable file."
178,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,The other files are almost as supplementary information. So you need to instruct people to look at the interactive report first.

179,P2_GMT20220714.odt,open tag,"One thing I would query is, because the interactive report is an html file ... could this be linked here? Because at the end of the day you have exported the file but maybe you could get people to view it here because you are essentially exporting a link of the file. But a link is a link that you could produce but you cannot hyperlink something that does not exist."
180,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,Definitely the interactive report is the priority file to view. It is very very ... There is a lot going on there that deserves attention.
181,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Task confusion,So is that task 2 completed?
183,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,"Okay so I'm going to go through the report. There is temporal and spatial information, there are lag considerations ... We have a lot more going on in terms of ... This is an interactive report, fair ... You can do lots of things with it and it is quite helpful."

187,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,I suppose my research focus might be on analysing the air quality with the health impacts. So the lag would be extremely valuable to me. It is probably the trigger period as opposed to the duration.
189,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Usable tool and data,"One of the things here is that this is more just the dataset, not necessary the data analysis.

190,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Additional features,"The only thing is that for my analysis I might want to exclude certain columns and pieces of information but I can easily do that with excel. I guess I have no choice but to take everything in the export, that is the only opportunity for me to actually remove the variable I do not need. So from my research point I want to be more specific about data that Ineed."
191,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Real use case application,But some researchers about Big Data that don't understand the problem fully might want to include all. So I guess it depends on if your audience is not someone who wants to narrow it to certain pollutants that works.
192,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,"Okay this is individual events A, B, C, D ...  very different plots. I can understand why you would like to see one, maybe see them side by side now that they are 4. But if it starts getting to large datasets then it is not feasible."
193,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Confidence in using the data,"So in terms of confidence, I would be highly confident because everything is available to me."

203,P2_GMT20220714.odt,open tag,One thing is to compare 2 events. But again this report has to have some limits and constraints so I am not too concerned.
199,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Additional features,"I am just wondering if I have to go back to the user interface. What could I modify to re-create a new report based on having looked at the first report? That is my approach, not everyone's but I can remove some of the data to simplify the report?"
202,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Simplify report content,Like a second chance almost because I recognised that some of the pages of the report are relevant but others not.
201,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Additional features,"But just going back to the UI and yeah. Removing some of the environmental variables while the event stays put, but the environmental data I don't have any control over that."
205,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,"The other feature would be perhaps in this case ... in step 2, the metadata table only appeared when I clicked those items. I was surprised and it came about that. Oh there is a file I need to import here, while in step 1 I always was clear from the beginning that Ineeded to upload a file."
206,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,"In being prepared for the process, I was prepared for 1 but not for 2, which I could have been. I think that is quite important as this could be an intensive file to prepare."
207,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"Maybe as an event as step 0 that you will need an event file ... Step 1, 2 and 3 are more about the process and step 0 is more about having the information ready for the process itself. This did cause by default which would slow me down in the process."
208,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Additional features,"Lastly, the aggregation method, could I have more than 1? But again, I don't know if that would be highly beneficial."
209,P2_GMT20220714.odt,open tag,So it is more about the temporal unit and aggregation method so you could choose more than one. But again it could create chaos with files and the report could become extensive itself.
210,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Lastly, the word event if you can ... serdif report you have this fantastic information with icons ... but the event seems like the event was something that needed to be explained.

212,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage process clear,I mean going through step 1 was very clear and very simple perhaps. It could be more complex but once I understand the length and the lag it is very clear.
213,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"Again, step 2 may need two sections one for conducting analysis and another for preparing the data for an open data repository because they are 2 very different tasks."
214,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,"Also this appearance of the very important metadata table that I find very important, but just pops out as a requirement."
215,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Linkage option clear,"Continuing with step 2, I had to choose some spatial and temporal factors and that was fine."
216,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Additional features,"I would like to have the option to select multiple options but it could get overly complicated in the report, the data outputs and the duration for running."
218,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Text or feature improvement,Step 3: the interactive report should get the attention first and the other data files become supplementary. The interactive report is directed to reviewing that and then you know what you have in your hands in terms of excel files.
219,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,"The actual report itself ... it is very well linked in terms of explanations and terminology, etc., which I think is good."
220,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,"There is little I would be suggesting. There is a lot going on to be honest, but in fairness the clarity and detail going into the explanations is very much existing."
263,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,A lot of information is clearly linked to the metadata files and I am guessing it comes back to the metadata file being properly prepared.

224,P2_GMT20220714.odt,Report helpful,"Yes, so this is the air pollution information which is important. Okay, yeah the units are also here. Two standard deviations is the threshold for the z-scores ... I suppose again as the report the one thing I am curious about is how does this ... Can you export this report? Because it is currently an html file, I don't know how long this html file survives. Oh no, it is a downloaded html file. It is not something linked. This is one of the things I would be curious about is the export ... Oh yes, you can export these figures."

1591,P3_GMT20220719.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"I noticed that for some of the pollution data there is no measurement reading, maybe this is due to the fact that there are no pollution stations nearby. Then, you can always replace that with some other distance like 10-25km which is what I have read in a manuscript."
269,P3_GMT20220719.odt,Real use case application,I know that for temperature that is always well done with good modelling and there is good temperature data in most areas.
270,P3_GMT20220719.odt,Report helpful,It is nice that you can visualise things. The average between let's say your sample and then you can link it to individuals but it does not tell you much information unless you are interested in the outliers.

292,P3_GMT20220719.odt,Data protection important,The rest is just ... I especially like the metadata bit because it is a lot of information which most people probably did not care to put together before uploading the data. The information would be sitting somewhere in a DPIA.

408,P5_GMT20220720.odt,Data table structure confusing,"It may be the case that the data has already been given but, does this mean that the data is from 12 days prior to the event? That is how I would interpret that, but I'm not sure this is right. 0 would be the day of the event."
409,P5_GMT20220720.odt,Plot clear,"Yeah, so I mean like my main impression is that you got the background like ""maximum temperature"" displayed on a colour scale like dark blue. You have the concentration of whatever you are interested in and years, you could pose a research question on that. I mean it is yes, nice."
410,P5_GMT20220720.odt,Usable tool and data,I mean I can really imagine myself using this in research practice when you have the environmental data you are interested in.

451,P6_GMT20220720.odt,Data available comment,I thought that you could link your environmental data with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. So do you have access to health data or do we have to upload it? That is what I am thinking. Would this interface include the epidemiological records for different diseases in different countries?
452,P6_GMT20220720.odt,Data available comment,So then maybe if you need to upload the health data you need to explain how the input events file should look like. Maybe the information is already there but I am not sure where to find it.
453,P6_GMT20220720.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"Besides step 2, the other steps are clear."

455,P6_GMT20220720.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I do not have a lot of expertise in this but I think it is quite easy to use and user-friendly.
456,P6_GMT20220720.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",So I think everybody can do it. If you read all the information in detail I think you can understand everything but I did not have a lot of time today.
457,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Text consistent,We have some nice little graphics here with a cross-section of the country with the time series of yeah some environmental data. That is cool.
458,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Text consistent,Okay that is fine.
459,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Okay so event A, these are two different events. These could be like the flare events or whatever health outcome."
460,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Oh sorry, it was the same flare event ... Oh yes it is the same flare event but at different lags. Then, these are all the environmental data."
461,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Data upload clear,"Okay, so we can upload our own data here or we can edit the table below by clicking on the cell and so on. Let me see ... by clicking ... Okay ... So event A, longitude, latitude ... Let's just keep it as it is as I am not 100% sure what to change. So Iunderstand what this is ... the name of the event, longitude, latitude ..."
462,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Data upload clear,"What does this export button do? Let me see ... Okay, yeah. This is how the data needs to look like if we were to input the data ourselves."

464,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage option unclear,"Okay, let me see ... This is a specific longitude and latitude point, what if you just wanted the square region here or something like that? I will keep going and try to understand it later."
465,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage option clear,Okay so it is just how you get the metadata.

471,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage option clear,"I guess it lets you pick ... Okay, NUTS-2 for all these countries. I am not 100% sure what this is but it would probably not be that bad if I spend some time looking at it."
472,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage option clear,Let's just go with the circle.  Radius of 10km ... Let's make that 20km.
473,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage option clear,Temporal unit let's say day and mean for the aggregation method.
474,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage option clear,I take it that it draws a circle around the events at this date and then I ask for the temporal unit.
475,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"Going through this in order now, the thing that confused me is that the lat/lon point was a very specific coordinate. Maybe it is because I read it too fast but step 1 left me thinking, if I want a specific region what do I do? I found out later that you could by drawing a circle around that region. That makes sense."
476,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"Anyways, let's just link ... Oh wait, what am I missing? I forgot to upload the metadata there, okay."
477,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage process clear,"Now I can link it, okay. It makes sense."
478,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Linkage process clear,"I think so ... If I was doing it a second time, now that I have looked at the whole thing, it makes a lot more sense now and it would be faster and easier."

487,P7_GMT20220715.odt,CSV output clear,The CSV file marked as sdev is the standard deviation of the data I guess.
486,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Filename not good,The CSV file marked as normals could be the z-statistic but I am not sure.

490,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Report helpful,"So we have some metadata here with different tabs I can explore. Okay, this is just a dictionary of the data and the input data."
491,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Processing steps great,"Processing steps ... Okay, so this is to check if I have done everything right and I can also check the input again."
492,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Processing steps great,This is the step by step linkage process which is fine. I will skip ahead.
493,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Filename not good,"Okay, so this explains what the files I was looking at. It might be better if you call them ""mean"" because ""normal"" can mean a few things. Okay, so this CSV file is about the means."
495,P7_GMT20220715.odt,CSV output inconsistent,"Maybe I am misunderstanding this ... So I don't see ""AsInPM10"" in the raw data, it is only in the sdev and normal files. There is PM10 here ... Okay ... There seems to be some inconsistency in the columns unless I'm misunderstanding something."
496,P7_GMT20220715.odt,CSV output inconsistent,That could be a glitch or something I'm misunderstanding. I will assume these are correct. Event B and C ... There is a value for C here but not for B ... Is this the same? Let me check the values.

Again I am not sure if there is a mistake there or if I am misunderstanding something.

I am not sure about this, this would be my understanding of it. I am not sure."

504,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Okay, the data table has the raw values but it is colour coded by whether it is above or below two standard deviations. That is pretty handy, it is fine."
505,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Dataset structure clear,"You might be able to see some trends for some outlier events ... I don't see trends here though, at least related to statistically significant values ..."

507,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Filter table useful,"Oh yeah it works, maybe I did not notice that before. That makes sense, this is filtering out whatever values I input."
509,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Additional features,"I want to see if Ican type more than 2 ... Oh, it does not work, it is fine as it is only a simple way to isolate the events, that's fine."

510,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Report helpful,"Okay, if I wanted I could click these buttons to get more information about the background of the data but I am not going to read through all of it. Oh, actually I might get extra information about the data as I go along."
511,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,"So the background button, this is kind of handy. Let's look at the plot first. The plot presents the concentration of pollutants related to these events."
512,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,Maybe I can't see it ... Oh these are the boxes ... This button changes the weather variable in the background. The colour bar tells us the scale of the colours for the weather variables. We can remove the pollutants as we see or need to.
513,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, let me have a look again ... Okay, so these lines are the mean values per lag and the boxplots show us the variability."
514,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot not clear,I did not see that at first.
515,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,"For example here, we only have a line meaning that there is probably only a single value that corresponds to these means. Then we see boxes that show the variability, this is pretty handy."

519,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, this is for each event, let's try A. Okay, B ... Then of course these events are ..."
520,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,We asked for a 0 day lag here but there we have the 8 lag so these values must have been specified from the start.
521,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Plot clear,"I think I did not pay much attention at the start. Yeah, okay we started with a 7 day lag, okay. That is why it is only displaying starting from the 7th day lag."

526,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Report helpful,But this can be very good for medical researchers who do not have experience drawing plots. So that is good.
527,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Usable tool and data,I would think so but let's have a look at the data.
530,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Files not useful,The normals and sdev variables might not be that useful to me because I can compute them myself.
529,P7_GMT20220715.odt,Usable tool and data,The raw table is fine. It is in wide format which is the format I would like it in.
531,P7_GMT20220715.odt,CSV output inconsistent,There are a lot of missing values but I think this is not something you can fix. This is just how the data is. which is unfortunate.

534,P7_GMT20220715.odt,CSV output inconsistent,I am still not sure what it actually means as there seems to be some inconsistency with column headers. It seems there are some inconsistencies of what is available and what not. There were no values for that variable but we still have it in the aggregates.
535,P7_GMT20220715.odt,CSV output inconsistent,"For example, there are no C6H6 values here but we have them in the normals. I am not sure what is going on there or if there is a glitch."

I am slightly confused because this site does not seem to be smaller than the other one ... It could be because I am not a statistician. Red values are big if I understood them correctly so ...

594,P8_GMT20220720.odt,Researcher's expertise,I am wondering why I would want to pick one of those and put it behind but I am not an environmental researcher. It could be that I want that or more than one. I am not sure why you have done it this way. It seems that you have preferred pollution. I have a lot of control over the pollution and I can do lots of stuff for them. But it seems that I can only have one weather related variable at a time for whatever reason.

If I was doing that I would probably ... This variable is the grey one ... There are medians ... My statistics are not grey so I don't know what could be interesting here. If I have understood correctly .... Okay, so this particular value of NO is the average of the 4 events 21 days prior to the lag prior to the event which is 0 in this case."
591,P8_GMT20220720.odt,Plot not clear,"Why don't I have some of these plots with data going back in time? There is probably a reason for that but I cannot think of what it is. Oh, okay I have solar radiation going back there for longer lags."

764,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Confidence in using the data,I think I am confident in getting some reports out of the UI.
765,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Simplify report content,The one thing that is a bit difficult for me is that Ihad to read lots of text on the website to understand what I am going to do.
766,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Text or feature improvement,I had to know the meaning of the labels to understand the interactions.
767,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Usable tool and data,"Generally, I think it is a great tool."
768,P12_GMT20220902.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I think it is an easy tool to link the data.
769,P12_GMT20220902.odt,"Easy, time saving and better","After several iterations, for example, for the first time you need half an hour to understand everything. If I was familiar with the tool it may take me 10 min to finish the task."
770,P12_GMT20220902.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",The learning curve is a bit high for new learners but after that I think it is a great tool towards data analysis. Representing the time series and all the things I needed to get more understanding of the health events. combining the weather and the according air pollution data.
771,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Data available comment,I wanted to say that environmental data may not be able to represent all that we want. It could be interesting to link water or soil data.
772,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Usable tool and data,The interaction is very good for me. There are a few small expectations on the data.
773,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Data available comment,"Yes, I said before in task 3, I would want more data to be added like sensor data about remote sensing, well remote sensing is already included in the data sources. I would add water and soil data."
774,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Data available comment,The environment is a big area and more data could be beneficial but then if we have too much data it would be harder to analyse. If we just focus on air quality and climate Ithink it is enough to conduct an analysis.
775,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Complete output,"Okay, so the interaction is very good. There are a lot of components on the website and it is easy to interact with the data."

777,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Report helpful,The visualisations are good looking and efficient.
778,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Spinning takes long,I don't know if it is because I selected too much data but the linkage took a few/several minutes.
779,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Spinning takes long,"I don't know if there would be an option to optimise and get a quicker query response from the website for the data linkage process. Maybe it is hard, I know."
780,P12_GMT20220902.odt,Usable tool and data,It is good to use and just to make it  ... I think if you put in more effort it is not going to be more perfected. I think it is a very good starting point and I am happy with it.
781,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload clear,"Okay, so I have to connect data and health events. So these are the health events and I have an option to upload. I think you have shared with me an example of events data. Let me save it over here. That's alright."
782,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data available comment,I do not understand a lot of these countries ... Maybe they are related to the climate data but I am aware of these two data sources.
783,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data available comment,I do not understand why there are only a few countries or if it is just an example. I think that should not be an issue.
784,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text consistent,"I can see clearly that there are three options, details, it is very clear I have three steps. The icons seem very clear to me."
785,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload clear,"I have the event data over here, that is fine. The data was successfully uploaded."
787,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,I thought there was a chance for me to drag and drop or select a file. Maybe you could highlight the box in blue or something to understand that this is a clickable option. I did not realise at first this was a clickable option but now I understand it and I can import the event data using that.
788,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload confusing,"I can see that it has been successfully uploaded. Should I click again to upload data? I think now the data has been properly uploaded. Let me just check it ... Okay, so the data here is the data Ihave uploaded."
789,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option clear,I would like to go with the minimum metadata as Ido not require much.
790,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload clear,I think this is another option to upload the metadata. I don't have the metadata at this moment but I can use the sample that is shown over here. I clicked on upload and it has been uploaded successfully.
791,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option unclear,"I would like to have ... Let me read that to understand what ""as input"" and ""season-alike"" mean. I do not understand the difference between these two event dates."
792,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,Maybe a definition would be useful to have here. I can't see the definition.
794,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option unclear,"So I can see that season-alike is mentioned over here. What about ""as input""? I do not understand this."
793,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,You could add a definition of both of them that would make this part easier.
795,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option clear,I would like to have the season-alike 8 days before and after the event.
796,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option clear,Maybe I should go with a 5km distance radius as a circle. Maybe 10km is too much.
797,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option clear,Temporal unit I will go with year and aggregation method the mean or average.
798,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Apologies, but the 5km distance is not a valid input as you can only select multiples of 10km."
799,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: In step 1, you have selected only a few days for each event, so if you select ""year"" as the temporal unit you will only get a single data point for each event."

801,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Spinning takes long,Perhaps if I could see a processing time over here together with the spinning sign it would be nicer.
802,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Spinning takes long,"Then, I could have an idea of how long it takes to link."
803,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Export fine,It clearly states that the linkage was done successfully and that I can go to the next step.
804,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Export fine,The files are all in the FAIR format data which I am aware of and it should be good.
805,P13_GMT20220908.odt,CSV output clear,"LEt me just export this over here and see what Iget after unzipping the file. Perfect, I can see all of them in a nice CSV format."
806,P13_GMT20220908.odt,CSV output clear,I can understand that these are all the pollutants and the weather data that are linked from. I have an idea about the air pollution and Copernicus data so Ithink they have been linked correctly.
807,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Complete output,This seems to be a very good result that I can see with the CSV and TTL.
808,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,"Okay, I see the html file with a summary of all the details here. I can see them properly and I have a lot of analytics being generated, that is really impressive."

811,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,It gives a description of the data but if I was interested in some of it I would know where to go. Extra information is provided in the form of hyperlinks so that is also very nice.
812,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,I can see the lead author's name so I can contact them if I need to. This is very good.

814,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,I think this seems to be very clear and systematic.
815,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,"The SERDIF report is talking about the metadata, what data it is using and how the data is being used and logged."
816,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Dataset structure clear,Let me hover over the column names. I can see the units and variable descriptions.
820,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,The user interface is very clear and by hovering you can get the information that you need without googling or searching it on the Internet.
818,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Dataset structure clear,I can see some of the background values are highlighted if the z-scores are more than 2 sdev. I think it is a very clear way of identifying the particular pollutants for these particular events.
819,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Dataset structure clear,I can see pollutants for these particular dates that are over 2 sdev. I think this is a clear way of understanding this. It is showing for other events as well so I am pretty happy about this.
821,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,Overall it talks about several aspects of data exploration. I can see a dropdown menu here. I am pretty sure if I click here I will be able to select from a list of different parameters.
822,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"Alright, this is really nice if Ijust hover around and I can also see the concentrations of several pollutants. That is very impressive. Let me check if I can do it for the precipitation amount ... Yeah, okay."
823,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"If I do it for the precipitation amount, the secondary Y axis changes with the amount of precipitation. Then, I can see the concentration in [um] for the other parameters. That is very impressive."
824,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"I would like to do it for another one to see how it looks. All of them are mentioned in bands. Essentially, for all of these particular days I think the solar radiation is of this particular value. This is mentioned over here."
825,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,It is slightly difficult for me to understand first how this band looks but now I can clearly get it.
826,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,Maybe it is a minor comment but if I wanted to get the particular value of this band that would be good.
827,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,This is very interesting as I click on here to see all the pollutant concentrations. But I would also be interested in seeing the weather values for example for solar irradiance.
828,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,I am pretty sure this would be high but I cannot see the exact value. Perhaps if I could click on top of the bands and get the value over here that would be very impressive.
829,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"Otherwise, it is absolutely very good. I can see another weather variable as well."
830,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,Before we were talking about concentration and now about z-scores. That is very nice.
831,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"Even for a particular event I could see the plots. This is impressive, the plots are nice and clearly done."
832,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,I can see some options to zoom in and out. This is amazing as I can download the plot as PNG. The plot buttons are very intuitive. I can see the generated PNG and it is amazing.
833,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,This is very nice and clear and I can use this on my dashboard and in the presentations properly.
833,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Real use case application,This is very nice and clear and I can use this on my dashboard and in the presentations properly.
834,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Before doing that, could you explore the metadata categories in more detail?"
835,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You have some categories below dataset descriptors.
836,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Processing steps great,These are the different metadata categories. I can click on the input data which talks about what I have inputted. Processing steps are the processing steps I did in the previous example when I was clicking on. Here we have a distance of 10km radius. This shows the different steps I took when generating the report. This is also very useful.
839,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Processing steps great,"I am curious about what this is. If I click on ""Step 2: Results"" it shows me on a geographic map the specific location of the events and datasets. If I click on here it talks about the dataset of type air quality and EPA dataset."
838,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I don't quite understand what the colour area ""index 0"" means. Perhaps someone else working in this area would be able to understand this."
837,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Processing steps great,"Let's see, this is also very nice. I can see the pan options and I can drag the different events. This is very interesting. I can zoom in/out. The events are in Switzerland. There are 4 events each of them linked properly."
840,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Processing steps great,So that is brilliant
841,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,"let me go to dataset structure. I am aware of the structure but this is quite easy for me to understand. There are two datasets, the climate from Copernicus and the air pollution from the EPA. It may be mentioned here whether it was mentioned in the SERDIF data. Okay, climate data is from Copernicus and air pollution from EEA. Okay, this is very much in line."
842,P13_GMT20220908.odt,Data protection important,Data sharing ... I need to know about it because it may contain some user specific data or confidential data. I need to know who are the responsibilities and data controllers before I share the data with third parties.

Even though I can access the HELICALproject and ADAPT centre, it would be good to have a list of related publications for the community to track and explore. I understand it may be a bit challenging to maintain a community of publications that come out of this but perhaps related papers from SERDIF would be a very good thing. That is because I am keen to understand more about SERDIF."

874,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data upload clear,I think another important point is what you mentioned in the email that the data needs to be prepared in this way. So this is important for the platform.
875,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Export fine,"Okay, export output. Task completed. I will move on to task 2."
876,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Zoom technical,Can you see my screen? I think you can't.
877,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Yeah, I can see it now."
878,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,Red ... Does it mean that they are positive?
879,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,Lag ... Standard deviation ... Pfff ...
880,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"So it means that here at the event-A, not I don't get it. At lag 0, we have all this data. I don't understand this day 0. What is the message here?"
881,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Maybe checking the column can help you, the second column."
882,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Why has it changed? Why does it start from 12? Oh, no it starts with 1. I understand the number of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on as the number of samples that you were collecting. I don't understand the table."
883,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Then, lag ... day 1 ... The z-scores are everything that is presented here, right?"
884,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: The z-scores are only in the background as stated in the paragraph above.
885,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Maybe if you go on with the report the plots might help you understand the table.
886,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Oh, data exploration you mean. For me it is hard to understand the table."
887,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, so dates are backwards and on the Y axis we have concentration. Concentration of what? Oh okay, concentration of pollutants."
888,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,So per day this is the concentration of particulate matter. Okay. These are concentrations of pollutants and these are the weather ones.
889,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,What is the plot telling me then? Higher wind speed means there should be less particles.
890,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,Why does the z-score plot tell me? The plot is complicated to understand.
891,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,"The plots represent the tendencies so the peak here means that the maximum temperature around 5ªC is related with the maximum concentration of PM10. How would that be connected with the days? Okay, that all happened 20 days before today. Higher wind speeds, lower the concentration of the particles. When the wind is slow or stable more particles can be detected. More temperatures, more particles ... There seems to be a connection there. Higher humidity, more particles, meaning that there is a positive correlation."
892,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"The plots seem to be very similar. I am confused about the z-scores. The z-scores tell us if the changes are significant or not. Okay, so ... Okay, so everything within this window I imagine it can be significant, right? Wait no, it should not."
893,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,The standard deviations ... Yeah usually I would have box plots or bars to understand the values.
894,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: The box plots are available if you click the boxes on the legend.
895,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"Oh, okay. This is not intuitive."
896,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, so I see now. For example, I just want to see PM2.5 ... I don't have them. Okay, so there are no values for PM2.5, right? If I just stay with PM10, okay. I will check with the wind speed. Okay, beautiful. 5 days ago there was very low wind and a higher concentration of PM10. Whether this is significant or not, I can check with the z-scores. This is what z-scores tell me right?"
897,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"So the z-score is when you have the bar plot it would be the deviations there, right?"
898,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You could try to plot the box plot by clicking the legend in the plot as you did before.
899,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"Ah, yes okay. There it is. If I click it here ... What does this line here mean?"
900,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: That there is only a single value for this variable across all the events that you have linked.
901,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"No, no this dashed line what does it mean."
902,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Above the red line is a high value, 2 sdev above the mean, and below the blue line, 2 sdev below the mean."
907,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"So, this means that you cannot trust this data then."
903,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: No. Values within the two dashed lines are normal values that are not considered abnormal values.
908,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,This is abnormal then ...
904,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: No. It is telling you how far a value is from the mean.
906,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, so this happened and this is it. This is what z-scores are trying to tell you, okay."
905,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Would you mind checking the metadata section before moving to task 3? You can click on the categories on the left.
905,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Metadata section hard to see,MODERATOR: Would you mind checking the metadata section before moving to task 3? You can click on the categories on the left.
909,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Report helpful,Ah so these are the geographical point of where the events happened.
911,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,I do not understand the lag thing ...
912,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: There is a diagram in the introduction of the SERDIF interface.
910,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Lag ... Pfff ... before event No, I don't understand this either."
913,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Don't worry, you can move on to the next metadata sections."
914,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Real use case application,Probably in the future we will have to use this data.
915,P14_GMT20220909.odt,No confident in using data,I am not very confident though with this kind of data.
916,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Text or feature improvement,I will need a lot of additional information.
917,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Starting from the basics, but I guess this would be the basics but I do not understand the events."
918,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,The plots are pretty clear but I don't know the significance of those events.
918,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,The plots are pretty clear but I don't know the significance of those events.
919,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"How can we build a correlation to understand if the variables are significant or not? I would like to make sure the correlations are significant to trust this is what is happening in the data, so the confidence in this data. I would like to visualise it in this kind of plot."
920,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"The z-scores are only telling you if there are abnormal values. I am not sure whether it is makeable, but probably it would be easier to merge these two plots. Like putting the star sign we have in p-values, this would make it easier to understand. It would mean that this is an abnormality and that you would not expect that to happen."
921,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot clear,"So those event figures are the same figures but for particular events. So they are separated data. Okay, so there are good points."
923,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,This is what I am missing here. So the overall figures are the mean or sum of all the available events.
922,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Plot not clear,"So what I think it would be relevant, I don't know how, but to say that the significance of this. Whether it is similar when we compare multiple days, how confident are we with this data?"
924,P14_GMT20220909.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",It is nice to have this type of platform.
925,P14_GMT20220909.odt,No confident in using data,If I look at this table Iam not very confident in understanding what it is telling me.
926,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,"It is one day before ... Well with lag I am not clear at all ... So these variables are the mean for 1 day for a single event. Here the PM what does it mean? Okay, the colour here is above the threshold."
927,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Text or feature improvement,I think you should add more explanation about what the colours mean.
928,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Text or feature improvement,"The units? I do not see any units here? Where are the units? Is it true that there are no units? Ah, okay here. Oh no there are no units."
930,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Data table structure confusing,When you click on data it changes very wierd the sorting of the rows.
929,P14_GMT20220909.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Okay, what do those numbers in the first column mean? Remove this column as it does not bring any information. Okay, alphabetical order or descending order when I click on this."
931,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Task confusion,"Do I have to give you another example? Oh, no okay, I have to explain ..."
932,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: You can just scroll down and keep going, no need to provide another example."
933,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Data upload confusing,"I can select 1 event for instance the A event and drag it to the box. No, this is not working."
934,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Data upload confusing,I understand that I have to put all the data in this step but I don't understand why I cannot drag the events from the table to the box.

942,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Linkage option clear,The temporal unit is days because the interval is in days.

955,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot not clear,I am not sure if particulate matter is the only pollution variable but it is here.
957,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot clear,The sample variability is related to the length of each box.
958,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, the pollution part of the air parcel is what is represented on the plot by the different lines and the concentration is related to all of these parameters of pollution. Wind speed is represented on the right part only, which I can change for other weather parameters."
959,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot clear,"In this figure, I see the z-scores of the weather and air pollution data."
961,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot clear,"I can also swap the wind speed for temperature as I did before. These are the events ... The number of observations that are above the mean, the higher the more different from the mean."
960,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot clear,I can also see the boxes with different lengths.
962,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Plot not clear,I am not sure about the colours of the boxes now ...

966,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Report helpful,At first sight Isee that the data is more tidy and it is useful to see the data in these interactive tables. The tables allow me to show a single event or for specific dates for all the pollutants I need to see.
967,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Report helpful,The plots are useful for me to visualise the data in another way that is more easy to do an interpretation for me than in a table.

974,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Report helpful,It is also useful to change the background scenarios that affect your data and it is easy to follow the evolution of the events. The z-score is a valuable tool to understand the extreme or abnormal events and how they are separated from the mean values. It is easy to detect them on the plot.
976,P15_GMT20220914.odt,Report helpful,It is also good to see all the events individually in case you have lots of data as it allows you to work easily with each event.

1100,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: In step 1, you have selected only a few days for each event, so if you select ""month"" as the temporal unit you will only get a single data point for each event."
1101,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: The length in the input table refers to the length of the time series that will be associated to each event, in this case it would be of 14 days."

1103,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: I would advise to check the diagram on the top in the introduction. You will see that you are getting data for a specific event. It gives you a granular view per event so you can do the aggregate afterwards.
1104,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Okay, we have some points within a region which are datasets and the event is within this region. What we are doing is to aggregate all the environmental datasets per event for a certain time window."
1105,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Linkage option unclear,"But here we have 4 events in 4 different rows, regardless.  I would assume that you compute the mean of the month of all A. The temporal aggregation in my mind, it should have been location specific."
1106,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Exactly, in this case because you are only selecting 14 days if you compute the mean you would get a single point for each event because you don't have more than 30 days."
1108,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Linkage process clear,"Okay, I see. So will get the same dataset in a way."
1107,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: So you would get one data point for all the variables that are available, so yeah more or less you are right. It would be more or less what you have there but with environmental data as columns."
1109,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Okay, so yes it would take the same table with some variables on the right. But if I do ""daily"" I would get 14 rows for each event with all the data."
1110,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data upload confusing,"Then the lag is 0 ... So it means ... In epidemiology lag means a different thing, the lag effect. Yeah this could be confusing but I see what you are saying."
1111,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data upload confusing,"From the date of the event and from the 14 days after the event we are going to get environmental data and lag 0 means that we are not going to get environmental data longer than this. But in epidemiology the lag is more about the days before the event occurs, right."
1112,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: The time window is the days before the event and the lag is the delay of the time window. For example, if there is a lag of one week, the time window can start 7 days before the event."
1113,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Linkage process clear,"But in the diagram ... Oh, okay the event is here, sorry I did not see it. The event is here, the lag is the previous days and then length is how many days I want to get data from."
1114,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data upload confusing,But why do we need the length here?
1115,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: The length will depend on each use case as different studies might define different exposure windows as this could be more relevant for the health event. For example, researchers might want to study one month before the event, the cumulative exposure of one year or the acute response after one week. So it brings flexibility."
1116,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data upload confusing,"So the length defines the length of the exposure. Then, the lag makes no sense, what does 3 days lag mean in a year?"
1117,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: In this particular example maybe the lag would need to be 365 days to make sense. For example, if in the hospital they did not record a clear date, you might want to take a safe range and say 5 days before the  event the person was already having some symptoms. It is to add flexibility for researchers as a parameter. If you are not going to use it you can always write 0."
1118,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Linkage process clear,"Okay, I see. So what we want here is days just to get more data."

1126,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Report helpful,This is the metadata that we were discussing. The input data is what we inputted at the start.
1123,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Processing steps great,The processing steps have the spatial linkage as 10km. So this is like the verbose of the linkage.

1124,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Processing steps great,"Switzerland ... These are the events and this is the area for each of them ... Okay. We have 4 events. I am assuming that the time window plot would be very ugly with 400 events. One event in Bern, Zurich ... Okay, I see."
1125,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Text or feature improvement,"You choose the average method ... I guess here you mean the ""mean""."
1127,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Z-scores ... The mean of what is observed or measured ... The mean of what? The mean of your datasets, the exposure dataset ... I don't know. But I guess you get an idea about the extremes in a way."
1128,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Dataset structure clear,"So, red is very high and blue is very low. Okay, so let me type event A ... Okay, so we have the event and all the variables."
1129,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Text or feature improvement,What would be also interesting in epidemiology is to have more information about the spatial resolution of this kind of thing. Potentially is from 25km if it is from Copernicus but maybe this is on the metadata. I would have liked to see how precise the linkage is.
1130,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Text or feature improvement,It is very hard to see the different colours.
1131,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,The shades are ... Concentration is [um] so we are talking about air pollutants. We have wind speed as shades because you cannot put it on the Y axis. This is for ... Is it for all events or for one event?
1132,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Text or feature improvement,"The mean of each variable across all of the events per lag ... Yeah, again what we are saying in publications is that you should be able to look at the plot and be able to know what it is. So you need to add a title saying that, then the background buttons, lag and concentrations or whatever. Because this really throws someone's attention, good."
1133,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,What is a bit puzzling is if the z-scores are calculated based on the event data or on the exposure data. If the sdec deviations are calculated from the events or from the actual sdev of the exposure data.
1134,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,"I would assume that it would be for the events because you are interested in the extremes with respect to exposure, right?"
1135,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: The definition of normals and sdev are in the metadata section of the report. The metrics have been calculated for each event for all the historical data that is available for a specific region.
1136,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Metadata section hard to see,Okay so it is based on the exposure data and not on the event data. Both of them have merit. In one we can check if it is extreme in normal climate but in the other if it is extreme in my dataset. If you have cases and controls it could be useful here. If the cases have constantly higher values then it could indicate an association.
1137,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Previously I had it like this but then I changed it to historical extremes as it was more useful for researchers.
1138,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I mean both are useful  and make sense. Imean again, as a statistician z-value is not the best way to do this but whatever, you would use this."
1139,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: What would you advise instead of z-scores for example?
1140,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Too close to analysis,I don't know why on the linkage stage we are interested in picking up the extremes ... It is a little bit going towards the analysis step.
1141,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"In my view and I have done several time the analysis of environmental data, yes you are correct the first is the linkage and then I want to have some sanity checks."
1142,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"Some plots that show me whatever, the exposure plots where my outcome is and how it is exactly extracted on the point. The first thing I do is to conduct some sanity check and then I start doing exploratory analysis like you have here with temporal plots and so on."
1143,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Too close to analysis,But computing z-values is no longer exploratory analysis in my eyes but more like I am going towards analysis so I am observing that.
1144,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,We have some extreme values ... I don't know what it tells you exactly ... So we have an extreme value 11 days before the event exposure ... I don't know what that means. We see that for example PM might have some sort of ... No this is the mean across the events. So what does it tell you?
1145,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: So just the mean could be a bit misleading but if you click on the boxes on the legend. Underneath the legend, for example can you see the boxes there? You can click one of them to visualise them together with the legend."
1146,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Narrow boxes can mean that the events have similar exposures. If they are wide, the values across the events are not similar."
1150,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,What does it mean if the value of this is 2 sdev above the mean?
1149,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: It means that you had an anomaly in the climate and air pollution data worth taking a look at. It is to provide context to the data. This would be telling you if a value is high or low compared to the normals. For example, if a value at lag 7 for all the events is high then there might be something in the air that might be related with the event."
1148,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: It was trying to give you a bit more exploratory analysis or information about the context of the data before your analysis. Each researcher might conduct their own analysis so I can see why this can be a bit misleading there.
1151,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,"Yeah, again it is the mean of the events so you are flagging if the mean of the events is extreme not if a particular event has extreme values."
1147,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Yeah, it was more of an overview and then on the next step you have them individually."
1152,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Too close to analysis,"Okay, I think this also can lead a lot of people to biassed results. What I am saying is that, if you select your lags based on what you see on the data then of course you are going to report something significant."
1153,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Too close to analysis,The goal here and in general is that you initially have to set the lag period (e.g. three days) regardless of the data. I do not think this is something you should see on your exploratory analysis because it can bias your decisions.
1154,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Too close to analysis,"But again, it is information and some people may need it but others not ... I have never used a plot like this. But again, it is my take."
1155,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: We can discuss it after.
1156,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Plot not clear,So what you are saying is that for A we have different concentrations ... This can be very massive for many events. Why don't we have lines for this variable here? Maybe it is incomplete.

1159,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"So basically I would like to select Copernicus for instance to get an idea this is the correct thing I am using. For example, by plotting the temperature or whatever. Then, if I am sure this is the data I want, I would go through all of this procedure."
1160,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,And then some sanity checks between the linkage of the events and exposure. You had it somewhere I think but maybe some more ... Like a map of temperature and then put the point on the map and see interactively that this is the right thing.
1161,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"Again, this is one date but just for sanity checks."
1162,P18_GMT20220905.odt,CSV output inconsistent,"Now I am thinking, why do we have 5 points? Everything should be from the same source here."

1163,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"So again, what I would have ideally liked to be more confident in using the linked data is to have sanity checks to see some values of the exposure and the outcome and see that what it has been done in the background this what I wanted to do."
1164,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Additional features,I would have liked more information with respect to selecting the exposure but this is on me.
1165,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Additional features,What if I don't want maximum temperature and only wind speed for instance? How do I select that?
1166,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data available comment,Then you have Copernicus for only a few countries which is a bit restrictive.
1167,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Additional features,I mean I would have liked to go to Copernicus instead on this page ... I mean Copernicus ... It should be relatively easy to implement a variable selection from the variables on your website. So people are more flexible on it.
1168,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Real use case application,I don't know. I am just saying that it may be interesting to select the metrics that you want because now we have 4 points but the analysis I am conducting on my research has 1.5 Million points. I cannot do all the variables for Copernicus as it would be a waste of memory and time.

1170,P18_GMT20220905.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I think it was a pleasant experience and it was relatively easy.
1172,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Simplify report content,I think that too much text is a bit daunting but at the same time you need to have the information there. So I guess it is hard to select how much text and information you should have there.
1173,P18_GMT20220905.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",It was easy.
1174,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data available comment,I would say that in my experience it is nice that we have these integrated datasets inside but maybe what if I want to upload my datasets to do the linkage. If I can input my event dataset on my own why I cannot add my environmental dataset too?
1175,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Report helpful,But I think it was a pleasant experience. I really enjoyed the html with the summary. It is nice to see some plots directly.
1176,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"Yeah, anyhow it is nice to see the plots directly but I need more sanity checks here so Ican check that the linkage has been done correctly."
1177,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Sanity checks,"For temperature, you could have boxplots over the year to see the seasonality or other things for people to get some sanity checks so people are confident on the data."
1178,P18_GMT20220905.odt,Data protection important,"The last thing if you asked me if I could use it, I would have said no. That is because I am using the health data in a private network without internet access so even if I did have internet access. I would not have been able to upload the postal codes of people or the corresponding geocodes of people that have been hospitalised daily. It is something against patient confidentiality so I would not be able to perform this task. But for another dataset that I can upload online it is fine."

1179,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Simplify report content,I will read all of this stuff aloud as there is quite a lot of text.
1180,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text consistent,I can see there are 3 steps and the overall flow of the website looks like there is introductory information at the start and then the steps.
1181,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text consistent,The introductory information looks like the background information I would need to know to use the resource.
1182,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,I suppose you mean a geographical area as opposed to a disease area.
1183,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Researcher's expertise,I think although linking environmental data with clinical data is not my exact current area of work I am interested in.
1184,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"It sounds like this is a time period that is being linked to a geographical area, which is fairly clear."
1185,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Maybe having the words ""geography"" or ""in time"" or similar words would make it more clear it would be helpful."
1186,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"The result of a semantic query, although I know that it is what is happening here, that made the sentence harder to understand. I would add another sentence to clarify ""semantic technology""."
1187,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text consistent,"The diagram probably can be something similar as we have a map of Ireland and data points in a geographical area. There we have datasets and data points and now we have the same data in a graph form. This represents an individual that had an event. These are the different environmental variables within the data like UV radiation, PM, temperature and so on. This is the exposure data and this is the amount of exposure this person had."
1189,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text consistent,Is this exposure data likely to coincide with the event? A lag is in the context of trying to work out the cause and effect or relationship mechanism. The lag could be the time for the disease to develop.
1190,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text consistent,The example here makes sense.
1191,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I think A-flare-01 looks quite code-like, perhaps that could be expanded to something that could explain a bit more about being a flare for a particular patient. It is a good code but it could take longer for an intermediate reader to understand that."

1193,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data available comment,"Sorry, I might be a bit too penequity but I will click to the data sources out of interest. It looks like the sites of Copernicus even though I am not quite familiar with it. The pollution data is from EEA."
1194,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage process clear,"It sounds like a really clear three steps, three is the magic number. I always like to summarise things in threes, which is a nice way to do it."
1195,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data upload clear,It looks like Ican drag and drop or select a file.
1196,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Oh, so I can click on that. Maybe you can add some additional markup of that text because I assumed that when I clicked on it I wouldn't be able to click on it. Also, when I hovered over a hand or a change in the pointer did not happen which you would expect for an interactive part."
1197,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data upload clear,"So, what I will maybe do is to click on the fields and then export them, which is quite nice to play around with. I will change some of these items out of interest. I will make the length all 20."
1201,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Okay, when Ifill that in it works but for whatever reason it looks like ... Yeah, so when I enter a value but I click out of the table it does not seem to record the value."
1199,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Researcher's expertise,Lag ... So this might be due to my lack of familiarity with environmental data but I don't know why I would select a different lag period for a clinical event. I don't know when I would have different lags but for purposes of using this I will add just a row.
1200,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Real use case application,Event E ... I don't know exactly where this lat/lon is but I am sure if I were a researcher using this that wouldn't be a problem.
1202,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Usable tool and data,It is overall very nice and clear in a clean interface to use.
1203,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data upload clear,"I will just now upload the table, okay that was very slick. I thought I had to export it and then upload it again but the ""upload table"" button is here with a clear message here that it has worked."
1204,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data upload confusing,I did not realise that immediately from the text above that. It wasn't until I got down there that I realised that I could upload the data there.
1205,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage option unclear,"So all of the steps seem to be that they will be recorded and that my interaction with it will be recorded. If that is the case, if I were to use it with real data I would be given a login to trace what the user is doing or maybe I miss understood that."
1207,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage option unclear,Oh wait it is more just recording my methods of how it is done so Ican check what I did. I might read that again as I think I might be slow in reading it.
1206,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data protection important,"Oh, okay. If I use this interface, aspects of the personal data might end up in the metadata report. If I need to share that or reuse it within another context then it would require the appropriate data protection permissions in order to do that. That makes sense I think."
1592,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Rigid linkage purposes,This sounds to conduct data analysis within a team and the other to publish it on the web. There might be an intermediate step where you might want to publish some of the results of the data analysis but not all the data. For some research user there might be some inbetween stage between those two. They sound like maybe the two extremes on the spectrum on how you might use the output for.
1209,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Usable tool and data,"Okay, cool. There was a nice clear cross to remove the message when I wanted too."

1212,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,Unless somebody has me like a form like this with an explainer of each row.
1213,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage option unclear,"Some of this looks a bit complicated, I do not necessarily understand all of it. It looks like it has to do with permissions on the organisation that is carrying out the research which may want to be attached to this output. I will just upload the example one."
1214,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data protection important,"So I suppose health data is always personal data unless it is irrevocably anonymised. Then, due to the nature of the data like rare disease data, the linked data might still be personal data."
1215,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage option clear,"Ah, okay that sounds cool and potentially very useful if you want to share some data making it more anonymous. It sounds like it changes the time but it uses times with similar environmental exposures, which sounds very cool. It is not something I came across or I have used."
1216,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage option clear,"Okay, I will try season-alike as it sounds cool. I will increase the time interval but I don't know if this is going to work quite well. If you extend the interval long enough you might reach different seasons which are likely to have different weather conditions. I will go with that for now but this is more of a research question as opposed to an issue to do with the interface."

1218,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,Maybe changing that to an input box with a dropdown list where you can only select the valid options.
1219,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Linkage option unclear,The aggregation methods ... I am not sure what this exactly means. I will go with the mean to see what happens.

1224,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Report helpful,I am sure we can figure out what is going on here by checking the html report.
1223,P19_GMT20220912.odt,TTL not familiar,"I am not sure what these datasets are at the moment, it looks like a TTL dataset. I was expecting to have a different dataset as a TTL. There is also the metadata as a TTL."
1225,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Filename not good,I am not immediately sure about the differences between these CSV files from their names. But I am sure that by having a look at the data one could work it out.
1226,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Report helpful,"I will look at the report then. I always love this automated output, it is nice. There is quite a lot to explore here which is very cool."
1227,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Task confusion,I assume I will go through and have a look at the output and describe what I am seeing ?
1228,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Yes, you can go section by section and it is up to you how much you want to explore."
1229,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Report helpful,This is very cool. It is quite satisfying to immediately get some output to look at before you analyse the data yourself.
1230,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Report helpful,"The way it is presented here may be a way that the researcher might not immediately have thought of using the data. I think that is really cool. Okay, if I click on that Ijust go down to the section of the document as a hyperlink."
1231,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Report helpful,I really like this way of exploring it. I think if it was just all the data in one page that might be a bit too much text. It is really nice to have everything laid out like this. I won't go through all these links at the moment but it is useful to have them there.
1234,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Report helpful,Nice way of describing it.
1235,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data upload clear,"So I got the data table structured in slices ... Let's see if I could see where those slices might be ... So we got event, date, lag, so these might be the slices. I think slice means this. Most data use data would think of rows unless event-A ... Looks like it is all event-A until event-B. It looks like there is additional data per event. This is because I set a definite number of lags and lengths."
1233,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Spinning takes long,I think it went up to a 100. Maybe that is why it took a bit longer because it was a lot of data perhaps?
1236,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Data table structure confusing,I am not sure about the slices but it might just be how they are described.
1237,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,"“Indices” is spelled wrong as the ""e"" is supposed to be an ""i""."

1243,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Plot clear,I can hover over that and Ican get information about the different time bars as opposed to the box plots.
1244,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Plot clear,I have used Plotly before. You can do some handy things like zoom in/out if that is useful. I think because you have used Plotly before I know that Ican download the plot as a PNG. I know that may not be that clear to the user but they need to go to this sidebar.
1247,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Plot clear,"I will try to change the weather variables in the background, that is cool."
1245,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Text or feature improvement,It is very minor but maybe the colour could change based on the weather variable because people could associate certain colours to certain variables.

I may just be thinking that this looks like ... Maybe you need a bit more background on what the files contain."
1252,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Unclear CSV content,I am not immediately sure if the values have been standardised or they are absolute values. I guess it must be absolute numbers for this but Iwas expecting a bit more data here. Maybe it is my own lack of familiarity with the data.
1253,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Unclear CSV content,"Okay, so it looks like data for each event over a period that Iselected in the dataset. This time might be giving me standardised values.

1255,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Processing steps great,This may be some metadata that describes the things I did along the way.
1256,P19_GMT20220912.odt,Researcher's expertise,I will answer this kind of hypothetically as I am not analysing the environment at the moment. Although it is something I might be interested in the not so distant future.

1277,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Dataset structure clear,So if that was the event at that time with a lag that at that time. Then you get the spill of environmental variables that you have produced.
1278,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Real use case application,"As you probably know, I am quite interested in SO2 after one of my peers did that analysis on the biobank so I will focus on that for the purposes of this experiment."
1279,P20_GMT20220906.odt,TTL not familiar,"Then, you've got all these files and I am not an informatician so I don't know what to get from here so I am going to ignore that."
1280,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Linkage process clear,This is just describing what I have to do or what you guys do to link the data. I guess it is what I have to do.
1281,P20_GMT20220906.odt,No preparation,So then I need to go on excel and create my own or can I just use this?
1282,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Yes, you can just use this and upload the data table."
1283,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Linkage option clear,I want to conduct some data analysis.
1284,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text consistent,It is quite nice that you have these little bubbles with explanations that are quite user-friendly. I like that.
1285,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,Okay I will name this GPA vasculitis. I am lost here but I assume the ADAPT centre is fine here given that you are conducting all of these studies.
1286,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,This is describing the dataset and where it sits from an informatics perspective. I don't understand half of this stuff so I will assume that it is fine. I am going to press the button to see what happens.
1287,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Data protection important,It is helpful to always remind researchers of government aspects. It is important.
1288,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Linkage option clear,"My intention is not to share at this stage, it is for my personal use, so I will go as input."
1289,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Linkage option unclear,I am not quite clear if I need to click all these ... I do not know what NUTS area is but I hope this link will tell me.
1290,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Linkage option unclear,"I am interested in the UK so that is NUTS-2. I am still not clear what NUTS are but I hope it provides some spatial resolution for my analysis. Okay, so I decided I want NUTS-2."

1292,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Yeah, I need to fix that but the distance needs to be a multiple of 10."
1293,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Temporal unit not viable,"I think the temporal would be of ""months"" ..."
1295,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: In step 1, you have selected only a few days for each event, so if you select ""month"" as the temporal unit you will only get a single data point for each event."
1294,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Linkage option clear,"So, I need to go for ""days"", thank you."

1300,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,I don't know what AVG function is but I guess it is the average function or something.

1304,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Processing steps great,Processing steps ... I guess this summarises my decisions.
1305,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,Data structure ... The interest of my outcomes
1306,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,"Data sharing ... It tells me what I can and cannot do. Okay, that is very helpful."
1308,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text consistent,It is quite a nice description as well.
1307,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,"""indices"" has a typo there."
1309,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,"Again, wide format might be a statistical notation so you might want to explain this."

1310,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,Sdev ... I had to work that one myself.
1312,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,"It seems sensible, helpful."
1318,P20_GMT20220906.odt,No preparation,"So what I need clarification on is what the event means. Do the events A, B, C and D represent a single patient? I think the event here is a relapse and a single patient can have more than one relapse. That is why you have got more than one C."
1313,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: An event is a date that can be associated with a single visit to the hospital. Then for example, you could code an event like patient1-visit1 and so on. It could be anything in this case."
1316,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: Anything that has a date and a location. It could be relapse1, relapse2 which could be from the same or different patients."
1319,P20_GMT20220906.odt,No preparation,What stage has been defined?
1314,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: This would refer to the input data on the user interface that you have inputted in step 1.
1320,P20_GMT20220906.odt,No preparation,"But for now, what is the commonality for an event coded A and all the ones coded A, and the rest that have C for example."
1315,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Here it is just an example so they are random events but for the purposes of the experiment you can imagine that A and B are different patients.
1321,P20_GMT20220906.odt,CSV output inconsistent,"So for the databases that are available, you did not have SO2 for these particular data resources."
1322,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Real use case application,It is good that the lag is built into this as a common challenge in all of this environmental analysis.
1323,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,Let's try with solar radiation. So here we have all the different pollutants. It is a nice visualisation.
1324,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,"It is exactly what it says there as it allows you to explore the data in a very efficient way. It is very nice, I like that."
1317,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You could also interact with the legend by clicking on the boxes there to get box plots instead of just the mean.
1329,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Plot not clear,"Sorry, which box do I click?"
1328,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: For example, if you click the orange box for NO2 you will display the box plot for NO2. The boxes are below the X axis, underneath the lag."

1327,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: So you can click the box just below that, the squared box. If there are no values you will get a line but if there are values you will get all the raw values."
1331,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,"Oh okay, got it. Interesting."
1332,P20_GMT20220906.odt,CSV output inconsistent,"The SO2, I am assuming that there is no data for the previous lags and this is a limitation of the dataset. So how come that SO2 is here but I cannot see it here?"
1325,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Some events have it and some others don't.
1333,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Data available comment,"Okay, so just these that I am looking at don't have it. I know I should be asking questions but if these are from the datasets ... Just because in this person's geography there was not a local dataset."
1326,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You could increase the circle or look for another time period.
1334,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,The other background variables which you can contextualise with. Yeah this is useful. Let's make some boxes appear.
1335,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,"I hope you let my colleague have a go at this, he would love this. Good, okay."
1336,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Unclear CSV content,How would I get the actual raw data to pull into a statistical program and go above and beyond descriptives of the datasets?
1337,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: That would be in one of the files that you have downloaded.
1340,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Complete output,"Okay, I will have a quick look at them then. Okay, very good."
1341,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Task confusion,Is that everything?
1338,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You can move to task 3 now.

1346,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Usable tool and data,Hopefully I have identified some areas that require a bit more clarity but you clearly made a strong effort to make this as accessible to all sorts of researchers and not focused informaticians or statisticians.
1347,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Usable tool and data,"Even someone like me, after playing with this for an hour I could get quite comfortable with this Ithink. So well done."
1348,P20_GMT20220906.odt,No preparation,I think my only confusion was on those events as discussed when defining them.
1349,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Data upload clear,"That could be made a little bit easier but otherwise, you being able to see that spreadsheet makes me comfortable and I can immediately pull that into a statistical program that I would be comfortable with, so that is okay."
1350,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,"You might want to have at the end of the report ""Here is your data!"". I know it is sort of there but just to make it even easier. There are a few spreadsheets there so sign posting directly after exploring the data so ""Here is your spreadsheet! Now go away and have some fun"""
1351,P20_GMT20220906.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",It is the easiest interface I have come across in this particular space.
1352,P20_GMT20220906.odt,Real use case application,"Again, the caveat is that I'm not in the weeds of this, so it is not as I have done this myself in another context.

1364,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Export fine,Now I am going to export the output which is going to be task 2. It comes into a zip file and then I guess I can just extract it.
1365,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,It is really nice both aesthetically and functionally wise. I think this is very nice.
1366,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Processing steps great,Processing steps ... This is really nice because you can trace back everything.

1368,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Processing steps great,"Oh wow, here are the events and stations used to generate the data that is really nice."
1369,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,Maybe you could use some rounding for the coordinates but still. Just because I am very neat and picky but I think this looks great and you really get an idea of what happens.

1372,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Processing steps great,The time window is also very nicely shown. You can export it if you want. I think this is really great because you can see when the event happened. I wonder how it would look for a lot of events but still you could get more or less an idea. I really like it. If you didn't know what you were selecting this would make it very clear what you are doing.
1373,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Okay so the maximum values should be ... Okay, really nice. Really nice and intuitively explained with smooth transitions."
1374,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, so as I understand. Is this for a single event or ... I assume this is the mean for each of the lags. So basically grouping by lag and then doing the mean of each of the variables during that lag. I think that is how you should look at it."
1375,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,"I wonder why we have 25 lag but I guess it is because we have different lags. It can become a bit annoying when we have selected different lags for different days but I guess it is exactly what makes sense. This was my instruction so usually I would not select different lags unless I have a very specific reason and Ithink that makes sense. Really nice actually, you can select the background like temperature for instance."
1376,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,"Then the same but with z-scores, right?"
1377,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I mean all these variables are kind of normal but if you were using a kind of non normal distributed variables, z-scores don't work that well. Well, they don't work at all. But I think these variables are close enough to a normal distribution where you can use z-scores in this sense."
1379,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Plot clear,"A z-score really gives you the capability to see strong anomalies happening to one variable. So we have them for each of them, nice."
1378,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"This one is not working for some reason, maybe because the variable is not working for some reason. Okay, if that is the case I think it should be somehow communicated because someone might think there is a bug if you get no feedback."
1380,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"I would say that feedback when some of the variables are not available at all. For example, event E, which is the one I selected, we don't have data at all it seems. Maybe I added a date that was not included in the records or is it in a location without data."
1381,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"We cannot see which event is it ... Oh, yes. As we see the NUTS-3 area has no stations meaning no data. So what we could do is to go upscale and do NUTS-2 and probably we would get data. It would be nice to know this but I don't know. I guess you could also give a message for this."
1382,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"Like if some of the events when you are located given an area ... But I guess I could have selected a circle and then it tries to find the closest one. Actually this station is super close and probably we would have been able to use that station. But yeah. Some kind of feedback on that if you are not getting data for an event for whatever reason, it would help to easily pinpoint. I know it is not so easy to pinpoint. I know it is not that easy to do so that's also nice I guess. I think that was a bit of a coincidence that I selected that place but it was good to pinpoint that. You can see it here but just to know that it is not ..."
1383,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Confidence in using the data,I think I would be very confident using this.
1384,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Usable tool and data,I think not only because Itrust the person who did it but because you can trace back where all the data is coming from.
1384,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Processing steps great,I think not only because Itrust the person who did it but because you can trace back where all the data is coming from.
1385,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,You not only have the metadata information but you have really specific plots that show you specifically where your data is coming from. Both in the temporal and the spatial scale. I think it is great to see that we are aggregating over this area and using the data from these stations to aggregate it.
1386,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,"Showing the temporal scale is also great because the user can really get an idea of what this means. Depending on how used they are to working with lags and windows, people might get lost with that.

1387,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Confidence in using the data,So I would be very confident using this data.
1388,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"Sometimes Ithink Iwould like to have a bit more feedback when data cannot be ... I mean, of course it depends ... We could assume that people that are going to use this are quite capable of getting data. But I assume  well, we did not get data for these, could we get it? Maybe just giving a hint like: ""We could not get data for your specified level of resolution for these specific events, maybe try to lower the resolution to get more data."" Some small hints like that and providing feedback on why there is no data for specific values that would be completely useful."
1389,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Complete output,"I guess you can download this table ... Can you export his table as a CSV? Yes, I think you get the export as a document itself. Yes, you get the values. I did not say anything."
1390,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Feedback on why there is no data,"Basically more feedback on certain things that did not work. I know that it is not easy but providing feedback when things don't work, but not when things don't work because there is an error that you could not have thought of, but these errors that you can expect might happen. Well it is not an error it is that there is no data for that specific location and time just say it or give something so the user knows why to discard the data point or actually get data that might not be available in the initial resolution that they might have wanted."
1393,P21_GMT20220906.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I would say well I don't remember when I tried last time but this looks really well.

1392,P21_GMT20220906.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",Like it does not look hard and you get kind of walked along each step which is nice. There are information nodes. You get the sources for everything. You get explanations for everything and the small things. I think it looks great.
1394,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Report helpful,"As I said, usually I would be more prone to using a web-based service but I think if everybody's computer can display and represent an html file like this, it is not an expensive process anyway. If in this way you don't really need to maintain the server side of this and you can just get the report as an html is up to the user's ability to use the page. Most users won't  even realise they are not on the Internet and that they are doing it on their computer anyway."
1395,P21_GMT20220906.odt,Usable tool and data,I think the whole way this works is great and I also like it from an aesthetic point of view. I like how it works. I think it is a polished work and it really works.
1396,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload clear,"Okay, so I took your example and I have added a few rows to it. So, I can just go in to get the file. Okay, successfully uploaded going to step 2."

1398,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage option clear,"Okay, it is telling me that I can have the dates as input or season alike. So the example that I'm uploading it has specific dates on it so I will take the dates as input."

If there is more than one, I guess it averages between those but maybe I can ask you about it afterwards."

1403,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Linkage process clear,"What this is going to do is apply the maximum operator over all those climate and air pollution variables in the same day. I am assuming that it is down to daily resolution so maybe that won't be an issue right. So I will get one value for a day. Then, I will link the data."
1404,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Metadata upload off-guard,"Okay, obviously where I was going wrong is the metadata so that is clear to me now."
1405,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Spinning takes long,"I have about seven events in that event data spreadsheet, well 6 events. It is taking a bit longer than I might have expected for 6 events hahaha"
1406,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Export fine,So it is just exporting as a zip file.
1408,P22_GMT20220908.odt,CSV output clear,"Now I am going to take a look at the zip file. CSV and a graph ... You can't see this now but Iam looking inside the zip file. Right, so what I'm getting out is a number of files here. So I am getting what looks like a TTL file, a normalised and sdev CSV files and a CSV file with raw values. Within that CSV file with the ... I think this looks like the raw values of the CSV file."
1407,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Would you mind reading task 2?
1409,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Metadata section hard to see,The metadata is just a standard example with rare disease A.

1411,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Would you mind exploring the rest of metadata categories there on the left?
1412,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Additional features,"Okay, right the input data ... Okay so this gives us the head of that import ile. Now, what question that comes out is what happens when we leave out one of these fileds here like length, lag ... What does it default to? For most modelling parts, I think the length could be set easily and the lag could be 0 anyway."
1413,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,"The time window is on the horizontal axis. One thing that I would say here is that if you have a lot of events this will become really crowded here. But the other thing is that if you have recurring patients, let's say that instead of an event you might have a patient id or number, and that may be repeated in the vasculitis case if we have relapses. So I am wondering how would it cope if instead I had a patient ID and I have a repeated index. Would it handle this okay? That is why I tried to use A-0 but I should have probably tried with A."
1415,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Processing steps great,"Okay, and we are looking at the max. We can't have everything but it is going to apply the maximum operator for everything."
1414,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Data available comment,Can we just get out the raw data as well without applying any kind of aggregation?
1416,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Then, it is giving z-scores ... So here, it may be a little bit ambiguous. It is not clear how the mean is actually calculated, right? Is it over a particular area or circle of radius 10km? Over what length of period of time, so may not be initially clear."
1417,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Dataset structure clear,"Yeah, okay this is very helpful because the colours highlight straight away values that are 2 sdev away from the mean as normalised values. Actually what we are seeing here is that the normalisation is done in the background and the table is showing the raw values. If the raw value is colored red it would be +2sdev away from the normalised mean."
1418,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,So that is actually helpful. Looking at this the other byproduct of this is that it gives the different pollutants and what kind of a normal value is. This normal value is specific to an area so how this normalised mean value is computed in the first place and over what kind of time scales are we thinking.
1423,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, so what I'm looking at here is an overlaid time series plot with each of the pollutants here. Okay, so if I click this for PM2.5 ... I have asked for daily resolution, which is giving me a single line which represents the level of PM2.5. Let me unclick this but click the NOx, it is giving me box plots."
1419,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Zoom technical,Okay ... Right if we want to look at ... Sorry but the Zoom conversation box was covering the second axis here hahaha.
1421,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,"I have to say that I am really not a fan of plots with 2 vertical axes, this is incredibly confusing."
1420,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"The purpose of this plot is to judge a correlation really between all these weather variables that are listed here. For example, sea level pressure and one of the pollution variables."
1422,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,I am not sure what the purpose of this is.
1424,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,"Again, it is the same sort of idea but we are looking at z-scores instead with the background variable as well. Maybe we are looking at correlations between variables."
1425,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot clear,So these are the different pollutants for the different events so we can drill down to the personal level and look at individuals.
1426,P22_GMT20220908.odt,CSV output inconsistent,Event E we are not getting anything so I am assuming maybe the lat/lon is off. I am just pulling out my spreadsheet ...
1427,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You could use the map in the processing steps category of the metadata. You can press the zoom out button to see everything to get the appropriate width.
1430,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload confusing,"Okay, this is event A0, A, B, C, D and E ... Okay, so I remember what I did now. I copied the lat/lon of A into E so I have 2 events happening at the same lat/lon but let me confirm that though. No A and A0 happened at the same lat/lon coordinates. I am not getting any values for event E ..."
1429,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: You could check the countries available in the interface.
1428,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Processing steps great,"Yeah, that must be the reason why because the event is located in Germany. I will go back and check that earlier that I got everything okay. So I might have to change the regions in order to get that one and everything else in Switzerland."
1431,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,So A and A0 but the actual plot looks different ... This is line and line+point so I might wonder why that is the case. Does this signify something as a user or it is just probably nothing? Okay.
1432,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Filename not good,So what I am going to do is to have a look at the ZIP file I have downloaded. I can pull out ... I would say that the names on the CSV and everything that comes in the ZIP folder are kind of long winded.
1433,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Filename not good,Would there be a way to put a string there in any way? It is fine obviously as you can rename them yourself. But just for convenience.

1435,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Data available comment,Just one moment. I am looking at what happened to event E in my spreadsheet or to event C. We have missing values for some of the components. This obviously has to do with the values not being available for the satellite or something else. There is not much you can do about that.

Would it be useful to do that for a user?"
1436,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Confidence in using the data,But I would be confident in using the spreadsheet.
1438,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Filename not good,"I think just to be clear in naming the files in the zip folder. It would be helpful, right. You have a -normals, -values, -sdev and another CSV."
1439,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Would you mind making a suggestion on how the filename should look like?
1440,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Filename not good,"Yeah okay, the -values just raw values ... -normals, let me have a look at that, the -normals are the sample means over whatever aggregation you’re using to normalise it. So you could maybe name the -normals and -sdev files as something like normalisation-means and normalisation-sdev to make it clear these files are to do with calculating normalised values."
1441,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Text or feature improvement,I think you can add more information about how this normalisation is calculated because what Iselected was an area of 10km so I am not sure how the  normalisation happens if I increase it to 20 km. I am not sure over what time scale the normalisation is. Is it over the study period or dates that I have presented or is it over a much longer time scale like the entire Copernicus back catalogue?
1442,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Report helpful,I think how the table is presented is very helpful as it gives a very much sense to the researcher of the scale of values one might expect. Easier for cross-referencing within different regions as well.
1444,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,"I think that the experience using this dashboard with the exception of the two vertical axis plots, is a subjective thing, because I always find them very confusing. So I mean you just don't take that as a harsh criticism and it is personal preference."
1445,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,The colour has to do with the bands on the background which were not immediately clear to me.
1446,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Plot not clear,"I don't know if looking at them I do get a sense of the correlation in some way but it would take me a while to get comfortable with. I mean, is this something that a researcher would immediately catch on and use it in this context. I am not sure, maybe, maybe not."
1447,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Data upload clear,I think that the whole kind of lay off and the fact that you can upload event dates is much better.
1447,P22_GMT20220908.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I think that the whole kind of lay off and the fact that you can upload event dates is much better.
1448,P22_GMT20220908.odt,Real use case application,"From the statistician side what we would be doing is uploading that spreadsheet of days putting a lag of 0 and a length of maybe 90 days or something. You have probably seen my colleague's work. Then, fitting this kind of a weighting function or inferring the weights on 90 days. Then, trying to figure out which of these variables might be predictive of the flare case."

If we are thinking about vasculitis the kind of incubation period is not really well known. You will have to know how stationary your event was because it will affect this PM since it is combustion sources that would differ immensely in a few metres.

1515,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Report helpful,To me it seems that I get a lot of information from the metadata about where the data Iwork with is coming from so I could always go back to the sources if I wanted to know more about the process of how data has been collected and has been linked.
1516,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Complete output,"So I don't think I would need anymore data. Yeah, I don't think so."
1517,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Usable tool and data,"I think when I get to the SERDIF UI I get a lot of information like an example use case which Ithink is good. I am not sure to what extent this figure makes sense to me, I think it does. I get information from what areas we have data to link. I get an overview of the linkage process ... Sure thing. I think this is interesting, it makes sense."
1518,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Data upload clear,"You have the event and you need a standardised CSV, which is fairly straightforward, with variables that make sense. You kind of know the format of the data and what you need."
1520,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Linkage option clear,"In step 2, I am curious about the purpose here ... Fair enough Ican fill that up in here, it makes sense."
1519,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Real use case application,If I was doing this for real with my subject level data I would be interested in the linkage process to understand what happens with my data when it is uploaded here. I think that is good information to know here but it is probably somewhere here. I know from experience that all of this is kind of shaky to use real data.
1519,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Offline deploy,If I was doing this for real with my subject level data I would be interested in the linkage process to understand what happens with my data when it is uploaded here. I think that is good information to know here but it is probably somewhere here. I know from experience that all of this is kind of shaky to use real data.
1521,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Real use case application,This way I could test it with different levels of granularity. I am thinking about vasculitis. I would probably do it at the regional level and not with distance circles and probably increase the temporal units.
1522,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Real use case application,I am not really sure what the aggregation method is here and how it will impact the data that I get back. I could always test it if I wanted to.
1523,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Export fine,I get confirmation of the linkage process and it is easy to export.
1524,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Report helpful,"I am going to the html without looking at the CSVs, and I think this makes sense."
1525,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Metadata section hard to see,You had to tell me verbally to look at the metadata subheadings and click those but I might have been able to figure that out.
1526,P23_GMT20220909.odt,Report helpful,Then this gives me some information about how I should interpret the data. This gives a good visual overview.
1527,P23_GMT20220909.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I think my overall experience doing it for the first time in a video was fairly simple and intuitive.
1528,P23_GMT20220909.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",If I had to do it again it would be even simpler.
1529,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Dataset structure clear,"So you have the date, temperature and some other environmental data."
1531,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,"I will try to edit one of these cells. Just thinking that when you can only see the number after typing and you cannot visualise while you are typing. Oh, it is gone now. If you click on any of these things you cannot see the numbers."
1530,P24_GMT20220923.odt,No preparation,"I do not have any to import here, well it is my understanding. So I am just going to use what you attached to my email, is that right?"
1532,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Moderator Assist,"MODERATOR: You could either use the one in the email or use this one here, up to you."
1533,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Data upload clear,"Okay, I will use this one here but I will add a row. Let's say with event E, let's make up a number for lat/lon."
1534,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,This one did not save my number when I typed it in. If I click out of the box it does not save the number the first few times. I will try it again to understand why this happens. If you click out of the box it does not save if but if I click enter it saves the value.
1535,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,"I would have thought that if I clicked out of the box it would save the value. Again, it did not save that one when I clicked out of the box."
1537,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Text or feature improvement,I was going to say that you should include the format of the date to type but it is there when you hold over the column heading.
1536,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Text or feature improvement,"So that is okay, maybe it would be nice to see the format that is behind date."
1539,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,"Again, if you click outside of it it does not save the number."
1538,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Additional features,"That is interesting, if you put a wrong date only with month and year, it still allows you to proceed. I wonder what happens if I put in a date that does not exist. Even non-real dates exist. You should probably add some limits there."
1540,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,"And again, I need to click return or enter to save the value there."
1541,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Data upload clear,Length ... What is this? ... Okay ...
1542,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Simplify report content,"There is a lot of reading here, a lot of bits to read."

1547,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Step 2 flow unclear,"So now I want to link it but Icannot click it. I did upload it ... but yeah, here we go I forgot these options."
1548,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Data upload clear,"Oh, it says here that you need to click enter. Did it say that on the previous table? Oh, yes, it did. I did not read that before."
1549,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Linkage option clear,Perfect ... subject with a rare disease ... Upload metadata
1550,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Export fine,"Okay, export please. That works. I will go to my downloads there."
1551,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Unclear CSV content,I have awful lots of documents now but I will open the report maybe.
1552,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Report helpful,"Yes, I opened the report kind of naturally. So that is done ... Let's see what this report says."
1553,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Data protection important,There is a nice data protection piece
1554,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Text or feature improvement,"There is a typo there ""intent"" not ""intend""."
1555,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Dataset structure clear,"So there is a lot of environmental data here. That is fine. Then we have a data table. So just looking at this, I have some kind of event and the environmental data which I can understand easily enough."
1556,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Data table structure confusing,"Okay, so this is a person in Dublin for example, but I don't see the lat/lon here ... And these are the environmental characteristics of that place at that time period."
1557,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot clear,"Okay ... I am not sure what the ... Okay, all of the environmental data presented in one chart. Double click on the legend ... There was a hint for me there on the right-top corner that now has disappeared. Mmmm ... Not sure why it is gone. Okay, so Ican include or exclude various data points. Let's look at Nitrogen and Iam going to unclick all those features. So this is the Nitrogen level over time."
1558,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot not clear,I'm not sure why there are different bars of colour.
1559,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot not clear,I'd suppose that is the average wind speed on a day. I am not sure what this grey refers to ... Background wind speed and it says 20 ...
1560,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Researcher's expertise,I'd suppose I do not have a lot of experience with the environmental data per se but anyhow if I click on these charts ...
1561,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot not clear,"Okay, so I will look at NOx, there it is. Okay, so I guess the box plots just show the error bars, the variation in concentration throughout the day."
1562,P24_GMT20220923.odt,CSV output inconsistent,"I am just looking back here to see what the z-score is again. That is funny there, those ones that only have little pieces of information there. It is the PM2.5. I suppose there is missing data."
1563,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot clear,"Okay, so I suppose A, B, C and D here are the different lat/lon points that we have chosen. There is no legend ... Oh there it is if you go a bit further down. Oh look the little hint appeared there again saying that I can double click the legend to make it appear or disappear. I am going to stick with NOx for the time being. It is quite clear from the greying out which is being included and which not, that is quite intuitive."
1564,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot clear,So what I am interpreting of these background colours is that on day 16 there was a wind speed of 2m/s.
1566,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Plot not clear,The colours are very similar. I actually don't think that the colours on the background match the colours in the gradient here. That is because the background colours are transparent and I don't think there is any patient with this royal blue in the background. Otherwise you would not be able to see the lines in front
1565,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Text or feature improvement,So maybe the colour in the legend on the right needs to match the actual colour on the background of the plot. Particularly if they are matching colours.
1567,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Linkage process clear,"We have linked ... I am trying to work out what I have actually linked. We have linked longitudinal data, like location based data. Let me just go back to the home page. Okay, lat/lon and date based data and Ihave linked what it seems like environmental things like the air quality or precipitation."
1568,P24_GMT20220923.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",This process was relatively easy to do for my dataset.
1569,P24_GMT20220923.odt,"Easy, time saving and better","I have the environmental data. Yeah, I thought that was relatively straight forward."
1570,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Simplify report content,I mean there is a lot of text on these pages.
1571,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Usable tool and data,"I am just wondering if there are good explanations for what each part does and you can hover over them, so that is good. All of my buttons worked, at least the ones Ihave used."
1572,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Linkage option unclear,"NUTS, I have not heard of that before ... Okay, so I will click on Ireland. Iwonder what this NUTS thing is."
1573,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Linkage option unclear,Nomenclature Units of Statistics ... Okay. I will go back to my page now. So I am NUTS-2 because I am in Ireland.
1574,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Unclear CSV content,"So I have a date and I have a lag, and the lag has to do with the number of days. But, why don't I have the lat/lon recorded in this excel file?"
1575,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Unclear CSV content,"It looks like I can edit that as well so that is fine. What else do I have here? Okay, so we have lat/lon, date, length, lag, point, datause, query ... It is getting very academic there now, alright"
1576,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Moderator Assist,MODERATOR: Now you have completed task 2. Would you mind completing the rest of the tasks by answering aloud the questions posed on the tasks?
1577,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Text or feature improvement,"I am looking at the report with a nice navigation bar at the top ... I am going to try the search box here. I will search for ""health"" ... Oh, let me try that again ... So I have searched for the word ""health"" here but I have not actually done anything for me that Ican see. How about I go pollution? Okay, Iam not sure that the search function is working. When I click enter or return it does not search for anything there."
1578,P24_GMT20220923.odt,No confident in using data,"To be honest, I would need to know exactly what this data is that Iam looking at. But I would have thought that on this data table you would have included both the environmental information and the lat/lon information."
1579,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Report helpful,"Okay, hovering over the column names gives me the units, that is good. It is certainly presented in a nice way."
1580,P24_GMT20220923.odt,CSV output inconsistent,Yeah I think that if it had the lat/lon information there would be important. Just even just to compare the old dataset with the combined/linked dataset.
1581,P24_GMT20220923.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",It is relatively intuitive. I have no idea what I was doing when I opened this up or what I had to do.
1582,P24_GMT20220923.odt,"Easy, time saving and better",I briefly read the instructions and I certainly did not read all of the instructions on these pages because It is very detailed. It is relatively intuitive.
1583,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Data upload clear,"I uploaded the health event data, I could do that. I added a row and it was no problem."
1584,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,Drag and drop this ... I cannot drag and drop this but I am sure I can drag my own document there. I will try to drag and drop something there. I am not sure if that worked there. It does not seem to be refreshing when I upload anything.
1585,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,The data table was successfully uploaded but it does not cover the second time. It does not seem to have to work for the new one.
1586,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Text or feature improvement,"When I clicked ""link"" there it brought me to the top, almost like I missed something."
1587,P24_GMT20220923.odt,Technical web issues,"I am not sure what is going on there but I might need to refresh the page if I wanted to submit a new query. I will see if this works now ... Upload metadata ... Link, okay I see that Ineeded to refresh the page."
