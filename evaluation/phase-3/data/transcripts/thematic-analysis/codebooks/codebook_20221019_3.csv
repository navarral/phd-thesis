Moderator guidance,"The moderator intervenes because the participant asks a direct question, wanders off task or the system has a technical issue. ",125
Data linkage process clear,The data linkage process is clear from uploading the health data to exporting the linked data,229
Visualization of plots clear,The presentation of the variables and functionalities are clear in the plot,112
Visualization of plots unclear,A component of the plot is not clear,50
Output data ready for analysis,No additional information is required to start the data analysis of the linked data as the dataset structure and content are clear and complete,99
Improved tool usability and output data,"The tool is easy to use, time saving and better than before. The output data is in a usable format to conduct research.",155
Real use case applicable,The tool and data can be applied and useful for a real use case,54
Improvement to text or feature,"Clarify wording, fix typo on a word, add extra information (e.g. tooltip), explain z-score interpretation bias and improve linking time progress",111
Positive comments on text,"The text provided in the web interface is useful, helpful and consistent",32

Technical web issues,"Technical issues when editing cells in data tables, due to browser settings or the recording platform. The web needs to be refreshed to export the output or continue the session.",42
Suggestions for additional features,Check upload input. Filter data table by variable. Add sanity checks. Select specific variables before linkage. Include feedback to improve data coverage. Allow for multiple aggregation methods. Offline deploy with own environmental data. Add research publications.,63
Some important features unclear,"Uploading the (meta)data is not clear, done twice or not expected; and the linkage options are selected partially, not in order or without valid inputs.",144
Output data unclear,The content or structure of the output datasets and the filename are not enough to understand the meaning of the data,72
